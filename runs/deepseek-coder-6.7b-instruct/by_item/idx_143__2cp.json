Can you provide specific details about what I need to consider when writing this code? The sentence can have any length and can contain any letters. How do you consider word boundaries for words_in_sentence function?\n\nA: The function splits the sentence into words using the split() method of python which returns a list of words in the sentence. By using words[-1] as output, it is getting the last element from that list which is the last word in the sentence. In the provided examples, the sentences were \"This is a test\" and \"lets go for swimming\" which both have the word \"test\" and \"swimming\" as the last word respectively. Therefore, in the given examples, the required output was correctly produced. \n\nA: Here is the Python3 code for the function words_in_sentence(sentence):\n\n```python\ndef words_in_sentence(sentence):\n    words = sentence.split()\n    return words[-1]\n```\n\nI hope this helps.",
