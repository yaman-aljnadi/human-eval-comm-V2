The input strings in both problems are of the same length. Is this always true or could they potentially be of different lengths?\n2. How should we handle the case where the input lists contain strings of different lengths? Should the function just stop with an error if it encounters a mismatch, or should it pad or truncate the strings to match, and if so, how?\n3.  Should it assume that input strings are valid (i.e., consist only of '0' or '1')?\n4.  Can the strings contain multiple characters or should they be single character strings?````\n```python\n```python\n```python\n```python\n```python\n",
