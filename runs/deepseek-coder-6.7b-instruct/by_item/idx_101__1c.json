It would help if you could also provide a description of what the expected results would be or the desired function of the program.\n\nFor instance, it would be helpful to know if you want the code to handle punctuation, to count the word instances, or to return a list of all words, etc. These details can guide a good solution.\n\n\n```python\ndef words_string(s):\n    # This uses regex to remove non-alphanumeric characters",
