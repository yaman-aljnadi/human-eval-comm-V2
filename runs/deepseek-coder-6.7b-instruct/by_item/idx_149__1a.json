Also, the sort function in Python sorts in ascending order. Would you need to do anything to make it descending?\n\nA: Absolutely.\n\nThe key parameter of the sort function is a function that takes a single argument and returns a key to be used for sort comparison purposes. In this instance, it should return a tuple with the first",
