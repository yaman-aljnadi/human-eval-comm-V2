However, the provided implementation is incorrect and does not fulfill the given requirement.\n\n\nHere's the implementation:\n```python\ndef choose_num(x, y):\n    if x % 2 == 0 and y % 2!= 0:\n        return y\n    if y % 2 == 0 and x % 2!= 0:\n        return x\n    else:\n        return x if x > y else y\n```\nBut, as you've noticed that the code is incorrect because it does not consider the possibility of both x and y being even or both being odd.\n\nHere's a correct implementation (in Python3):\n\n```python\ndef choose_num(x, y):\n    if (x % 2 == 0 and y % 2!= 0) or (x % 2!= 0 and y % 2 == 0):\n        return max(x, y)\n    else:\n        return max(y, x)\n```\nThis implementation is now based on the new requirement. It first checks if one of the input numbers is odd and the other is even. If so, it returns the maximum of",
