Your help is much appreciated.\n\nA: Here is the implementation in python to solve this task:\n\n```python\ndef pluck(arr):\n    if not arr:\n        return []\n    min_val = min(arr)\n    min_index = arr.index(min_val)\n    return [min_val, min_index]\n```\n\nThe algorithm works as follows:\n\n1. Checks if the array is empty, if yes, returns an empty array.\n2. If the array is not empty, the algorithm finds the minimum value in the array using the `min` function, and the index of this minimum value using the `index` function.\n3. It then returns the minimum value and its index in the form of an array.\n\nThis code should work within the constraints that you specified.\n\nI hope this helps. Feel free to ask if you have more questions.\n\nEDIT: I misunderstood, I misunderstood. The problem is: \"The plucked node should be the node with the smallest index if there are",
