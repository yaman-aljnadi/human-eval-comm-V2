Are they limited to positive integers? \n- Will the output always be a string, or could it be a list of strings? \n- Will the extra characters 'db' always be at different positions, or could they be in a fixed position? \n- Are there any specific requirements for how leading zeros are handled in the binary representation? \n- Should the extra characters 'db' always be present, or could the function return a string without them? \n\nLet me know if I need to make any changes before providing you with Python3 code. \n\nIf I provide you with code that is not entirely accurate, please point out the issue(s) and I will make the necessary changes. \n\nThis is to ensure your code accuracy and I am willing to make adjustments to ensure that it is correct.
