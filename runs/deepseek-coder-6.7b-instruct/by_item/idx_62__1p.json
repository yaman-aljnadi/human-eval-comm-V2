I'm not sure about how to solve this problem. How can I calculate the roots of this polynomial? I want to write a Python function that finds the roots of this polynomial. Please clarify if there are any special cases.\nFor example, if the input is `[3, -2, 1]`, the roots are x = 1 and x = -1. For an input of `[1, -3, 3]`, the roots are x = 1 and x = 2.\nI have the following python script:\n```python\ndef candidate(xs: list):\n    roots = []\n    degree = len(xs) - 1\n    for x in range(-100,101):\n        res = sum([x**i for i in range(degree+1)]) - sum(xs)\n        if res == 0:\n            roots.append(x)\n    return roots\n```\nI'm not sure if this is correct but it calculates for polynomial of any degree but I'm not sure how to modify it for the root.\nCan someone help me",
