However, the examples only show binary representations, and even those are incorrect for the given inputs.\n\nFor instance:\n- `candidate(19)`: The binary representation of 19 is `10011`. The example shows `'1100'`, which is the binary representation of 12.\n- `candidate(152)`: The binary representation of 152 is `10011000`. The example shows `'111000'`, which is the binary representation of 56.\n- `candidate(426)`: The binary representation of 426 is `110101010`. The example shows `'11111'`, which is the binary representation of 31.\n\nTo proceed, I need clarification on:\n\n1.  **Which representation should be returned?** Should it always be binary, or is there a condition to choose between binary, hexadecimal, or Roman numerals?
