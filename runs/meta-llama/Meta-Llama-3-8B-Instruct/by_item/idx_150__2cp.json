However, without further information, this is just an educated guess. I'd like to clarify if this is indeed the correct interpretation of the assignment.\n\nIf the above understanding is correct, then the function will subtract the value of `y` from `x` if `y` is greater than `n`. Otherwise, `y` will be simply passed back without modification.\n\nPlease confirm or deny this interpretation. If confirmed, I will be happy to generate the requested Python code.
