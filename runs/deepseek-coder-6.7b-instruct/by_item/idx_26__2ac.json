In the problem description it's only stated that elements that occur K times need to be removed. Could you provide more clarification on what K is in the context of your problem? As I don't have a value for K in the given example input, I cannot test it against the function.\n\nA: In the original problem description you don't state a value for K. Your function is only set to remove items that occur exactly twice. If",
