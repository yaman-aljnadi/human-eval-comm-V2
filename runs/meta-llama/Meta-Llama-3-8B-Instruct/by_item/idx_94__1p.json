Have you tried using a dictionary to store the frequency of each number in the list? If not, can you try and then share your updated solution? The expected output of the function is the length of the set of the list (i.e., the number of unique elements in the list). Please avoid using any built-in functions for counting frequency of elements in the list and instead use a loop or recursion to achieve this. Please also avoid creating any new data structures like dictionaries, sets, or arrays that would hold the frequency of each number in the list. Instead, use a list that keeps track of the last number seen and the first number seen in order to know when to stop the loop or recursion. If you're still facing issues, it would be helpful if you could provide a sample example where the code doesn't work as expected",
