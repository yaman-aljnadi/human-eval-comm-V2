However, it doesn't specify *whether* it should be sorted in descending or ascending order, and the example output `[3, 5, 9, 123]` is *ascending*.\n\nTo provide the best code, I need a bit more clarification:\n\n1.  **Sorting Order:** Should the function *always* return the unique elements in ascending order, as suggested by the example, or should it have a parameter to control descending vs. ascending order? If a parameter, what should it be named and what values should it accept (e.g., a boolean `descending=False`, or a string `order='asc'`/`'desc'`)?\n2.  **Ambiguity Resolution:** The prompt \"Return descending or ascending sorted unique elements\" is a bit ambiguous. Does it mean:\n    *   It should *try* to determine which sorting order is more appropriate based on the input (which is quite complex and likely not the intention)?\n    *   It should have a way to *choose* between descending and ascending?\n\nAssuming the most common interpretation and based on the provided doctest,",
