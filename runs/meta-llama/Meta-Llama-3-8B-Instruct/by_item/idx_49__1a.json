The code must work for x up to at least 32 bits integer and y up to at least 32 bits integer.\n\nI want you to implement a solution based on binary numbers and modular arithmetic. It seems like you should take advantage of properties of modular arithmetic and the binary representation of the input integers. It seems like you could use properties of 2^n modulo p for small values of n and for some p. You might need to consider the impact of numerics when doing modular arithmetic.\n\nPlease provide a Python3 code solution within this markdown. I am looking forward to your Python3 code solution.\n\n```python\n# Your Python3 code goes here\n```\n---\n\n(Note: This is a direct response, no need to post here.) \n\nHere are my questions:\n\n1. Do you want to calculate directly the 2^n modulo p, or you are looking for a method to arrive at this result in some way?\n2. Are you looking for a solution based solely on the given unit tests, or do you have any further constraints or guidelines I should be aware of?\n3. Are there any specific numerical aspects I should be careful about when performing modular arithmetic operations? (E.g., overflow, under",
