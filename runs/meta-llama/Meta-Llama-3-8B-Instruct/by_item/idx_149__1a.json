The code filters out strings of odd lengths, sorts the remaining strings by their lengths in descending order, and in case of ties, by alphabetical order. The sorted list is then returned. The unit tests are used to validate the correctness of the code.  ```\n\nI hope this code meets the requirements. If I understand something incorrectly, please feel free to clarify. If there's anything else I can do for you, please let me know.```",
