Here are a few possibilities:\n\n1. The print function has been removed in Python 3. You might have been using print statement to print something. In Python 3, print is a function, and you would use print() instead of using print statement.\n\n2. Python 3 uses syntax like 'x = 10' instead of 'x=10'.\n\n3. Python 3 does not support input as a function, so instead, it would use raw_input().\n\n4. If you are using a variable that is only defined for Python 2.x and would like to maintain compatibility, you would need to import it from the future library.\n\nHere's an example of a Python 2-style input:\n\n```python\nfrom __future__ import print_function\nx = 10\nprint(x)\n",
