Here is the code: \n```\ndef triangle_area(a, b, c):\n    if a+b > c and a+c > b and b+c > a:\n        s = (a+b+c)/2\n        return round((s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c))**0.5, 2)\n    else:\n        return -1\n```\nPlease note that this code first checks if three sides can form a triangle by using the triangle inequality theorem. If they do, then it calculates the area using Heron's formula. If they do not, it returns -1. The calculated area is then rounded to 2 decimal places.  | | | | | | | | 12.00, -1\nFinal Answer: The final answer is ``.

I understand your problem as follows:\n\nYou want me to write a Python function called `triangle_area(a, b, c)` that calculates the area of a triangle given the lengths of its three sides, `a`, `b`, and `c`.
