What should I do with the text input to ensure it runs correctly with different encodings?\n\nA: Python handles this automatically when you do operations like `str`. A string is a sequence of characters, and Python 3 strings are Unicode by default. So when you try to handle string encoding, it's not required in Python 3 because it can handle all Unicode characters, and you don't need to specify an encoding.\n\nSo, your function should work fine for different encodings including utf-8, ascii, etc., just because Python 3 strings are Unicode by default. No need to specify an encoding. \n\nPython has built-in functions to convert strings to byte arrays, so you can even convert a string to bytes which could be used for sending over network or storing to files (where the encoding is needed).\n\nJust ensure that the characters in your input string do not exceed the Unicode code point limit (U+10FFFF),",
