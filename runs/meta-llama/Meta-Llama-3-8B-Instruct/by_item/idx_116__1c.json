The most important part of the solution is to convert each number to binary format and then count the number of ones. Then the final output needs to be sorted in descending order based on the number of ones and also based on the original number in descending order. To solve this problem, a list comprehension can be used to generate the desired output. It can also be improved by using the sorted function. \n\nFinally, I hope your feedback is positive. I will be glad to improve my skills. I would be happy if you could provide some feedback. Thank",
