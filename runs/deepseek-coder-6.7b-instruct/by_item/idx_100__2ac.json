Any help is appreciated.\n\nA: The issue with your code is that you are adding an extra level of stones in both even and odd cases. You need to remove the extra stones. You should only add either current_level + 1 or current_level + 2 depending upon whether the current_level is even or odd.\n\nHere is the corrected code:\n```python\ndef make_a_pile(n):\n    pile = []\n    current_level",
