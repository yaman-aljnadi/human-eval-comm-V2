Also, the examples provided seem to imply a sum of 0 for all inputs, which might be a misunderstanding or a specific interpretation I need to clarify.\n\nFor instance, if `N = 1000` and we consider the sum of digits in base 10, it would be `1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1`. If we were to convert `1000` to hexadecimal (`0x3E8`), the sum of digits would be `3 + 14 + 8 = 25`. If we converted it to binary, the sum would be the count of '1's.\n\nPlease clarify:\n1.  **What is the target base for the sum of digits?** (e.g., base 10, base 2 (binary), base 16 (hexadecimal), or another base?)\n2.  **What is the expected output for the given examples?** The examples consistently show \"0\" as the output, which contradicts a standard digit",
