The cars are represented by the same type of objects that have speed and direction attributes. However, all the cars start at a distance of 'n' units away and they move at a relative speed of 1 unit per turn. I know that the \"detection\" of the car movement will take n time units and n turns.\n\nHere's what I tried:\ndef is_prime(n: int):\n    if n > 1:\n        for i in range(2, n):\n            if n % i == 0:\n                return False\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\nThis is_prime function is used to check if a number is prime or not which is a separate issue. I need help with modifying this to handle the scenario described above.\n\n\nA: The problem seems like a simulation problem. In Python, we could represent our road as a list of boolean values, where True means a car is at that position. We initialize the list with False for positions before 'n'",
