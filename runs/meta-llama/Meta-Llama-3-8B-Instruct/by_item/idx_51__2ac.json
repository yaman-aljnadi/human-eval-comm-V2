The function is designed to filter out all vowels from the input string and return the modified string. The code utilizes a set comprehension within a list comprehension to achieve this. It iterates over each character in the input string and checks if that character is not present in the `vowels` set (which contains lowercase and uppercase English vowels). If the character is not a vowel, it is included in the resulting string. Finally, the `join` method is used to concatenate these filtered characters into a single string, which is then returned by the function. |  #candidate  #string_manipulation  #set_comprehension  #list_comprehension  #join_method  #python3   ```  2021/6/3   20:34 ",
