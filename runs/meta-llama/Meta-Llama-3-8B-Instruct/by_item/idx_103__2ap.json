Are we only interested in calculating the max and average of the given range? Are there any other metrics that could be used? Yes, we are interested in only calculating the max and average of the given range.\n\n2. Would it be helpful to have a default value for n or m? For example, should m default to 10 or n default to 1? No, the code will only need two input parameters. No default values will be needed.\n\nHere is the python3 code to solve this problem:\n\n```python\ndef candidate(n, m):\n    \"\"\"You are given two positive integers n and m, and your task is to compute the\n    max or average of the integers from n through m (including n and m).\n    \"\"\"\n    return max(range(n, m+1)), sum(range(n, m+1)) / (m - n + 1)\n```\nExplanation:\nThis code calculates the maximum value in the range from `n` to `m` inclusive by using the built-in `max` function with a generator expression that generates a sequence of numbers from `n` to `m` (inclusive). It also calculates the average value in the range from `n` to `m` inclusive",
