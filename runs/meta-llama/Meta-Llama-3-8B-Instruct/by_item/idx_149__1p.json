I understand the requirement, but I want to make sure I'm not missing anything. Are you looking for a function that takes a list of strings, filters out those strings that have odd lengths, and returns the updated list with strings that have even lengths? –  @username\n```python\n```\n\n**Comment**\n\n@username: Yes, exactly! That's the problem statement. –  @user1234567890\n```python\n```\n\n**Edit**\n\nThank you for your response. Here's a simple Python function that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\ndef candidate(lst):\n   ",
