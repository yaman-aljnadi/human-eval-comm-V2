If they have guessed correctly, the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score. \n\nAs you mentioned, it gives a result on how far off the guess was, so even if the guess is exactly correct it will also return 0 in the output.\n\"\"\"\n\n\nA: You made the question very clear. We just need to find how close the guess list is to the game list. Zip function is used in Python to iterate over two lists in parallel. Difference between each pair is calculated with abs function. All these calculations are done in list comprehension in Python.\n\n",
