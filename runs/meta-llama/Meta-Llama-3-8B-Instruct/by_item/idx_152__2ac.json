It would be helpful to know what these outcomes represent.

It seems reasonable to make this assumption unless otherwise specified. |\n| 3. | It seems that a simple, straightforward approach could be used to solve this problem. One could iterate over the arrays and compare each corresponding score and guess. If the guess was correct, a value of 1, 2, or 0 could be returned.
