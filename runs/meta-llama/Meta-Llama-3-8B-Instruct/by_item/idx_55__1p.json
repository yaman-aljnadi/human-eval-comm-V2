Can someone explain this?\n\nThe above code is working based on the formula for calculating the sum of natural numbers up to n, which is `n * (n + 1) // 2`. This formula is derived from the mathematical concept of arithmetic series.\n\nThe significance of the operator `//` (integer division operator) here is that it ensures that the result is an integer, even when the calculation involves a fraction. Without the `//` operator, the division operation would result in a floating-point number.\n\nFor example, if we were to use the simple division operator `/` instead of `//` in the code above, like so:\n\n```python\ndef candidate(n: int):\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * (n + 1) / 2\n```\n\nThe output for `candidate(8)` would be approximately 20.",
