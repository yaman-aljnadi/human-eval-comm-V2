How will this code handle different test cases? For instance, when `n = 5` or `n = 10`, or even `n = 2`? \n2. Are there any test cases you would like me to run first before running this code?\n3. Is there any input validation you would like me to add? \n4. Are there any assumptions we made while writing this code? \n\nKindly guide me through this. I am really eager to learn from your expertise!  5. Can you tell me if there is any optimization possible in this code?  6. Would you recommend adding unit tests to this code? If yes, how would you structure the test cases?  7. \n\nPlease respond with Python3 code",
