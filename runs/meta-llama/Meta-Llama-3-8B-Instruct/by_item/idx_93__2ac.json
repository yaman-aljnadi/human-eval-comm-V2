However, there are comments within the code block to explain the logic. \n\nI have taken advantage of Python's built-in string and ord functions to accomplish this. \n\nHere is the breakdown of the code:\n\n- I start by defining a string `vowels` that contains all English vowels (both lowercase and uppercase).\n\n- I then use a list comprehension to first swap the case of all letters in the message (i.e., make all uppercase letters lowercase and vice versa), except for vowels (which I keep as is).\n\n- Next, I use another list comprehension to iterate over the message again. This time, I use the `ord` function to get the ASCII value of each character. If the character is a vowel, I add",
