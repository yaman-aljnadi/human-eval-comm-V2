Here, as a simple example, we will use a Caesar Cipher. The Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher in which each character of the original text is'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef encrypt(s):\n    encrypted_s = \"\"\n    for c in s:\n        # for each character, shift it 3 places down the alphabet\n        encrypted_s += chr((ord(c) - 65 + 3) % 26 + 65)\n    return encrypted_s\n```\n\nThis code works by looping through each character in the string. For each character, it gets its ASCII value (with `ord(c)`), subtracts 65 (to convert it to a 0-25 based system, where A is 0, B is 1, etc.), adds 3 (the shift), then applies",
