I've implemented a simple algebraic expression evaluator. It assumes the operator list has at least one operator and the operand list has at least two operands. It also assumes the operand list's first element is a special case where it should be considered as the first operand for the expression evaluation. I used the `operator` module's `itemgetter` function to fetch the operators from the operator list. For simplicity, this code does not handle any exceptions for invalid operations or out-of-range indices. For production code, you would need to add proper error handling. Here is the Python3 code:\n\n```python\n",
