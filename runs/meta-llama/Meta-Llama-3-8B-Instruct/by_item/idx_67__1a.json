Is the given string always in the format of \"X apples and Y oranges\"?\n2. Are there any other types of fruits in the basket, and if yes, how do we handle them in our code? Do we just ignore them?\n3. Are there any cases where the given string may not have the exact words \"apples\" and \"oranges\", such as \"apple\", \"orange\", \"appleses\", etc?\n4. Will the given string always have the words \"apples\" and \"oranges\" in any order, meaning the output of the function may depend on whether it first finds \"apples\" or \"oranges\" in the given string?\n5. Are there any potential exceptions or errors in the given string that we should handle in our code? For example, what if the given string represents a decimal number or a negative number instead of an integer number of fruits?```\n\n\n\nPlease respond with either the Python3 code or clarifying questions.```python\ndef fruit_distribution(s, n):\n    words = s.split()\n    apples = 0\n    oranges = 0\n    for word in words:\n        if word",
