For example, given a sentence 'Hello world' and 'n' = 5, the function should return ['world'] because 'world' is a 5-letter word. If there are multiple such words in the sentence, you should include all of them in the returned list.\n\nHere is an example of how you can test your code:\n```python\nprint(select_words(\"I love to code\", 3))  # Output: ['love', 'code']\nprint(select_words(\"Hello world\", 5))  # Output: ['world']\nprint(select_words(\"Python is fun\", 4))  # Output: ['code', 'fun']\n``` \n\nRemember, we're only interested in counting words that have the same length as 'n'.```\"\",\"```n\"\"],\"\"\"n\"\"\"]\n\n### Clarifying Questions:\n\n1. Are there any spaces in the string s? How would the code handle such spaces?\n2. Will the code function correctly even if there are words of different lengths in the string s?\n3. Should the code handle non-alphabetical characters, such as punctuation marks, numbers or special characters? What should",
