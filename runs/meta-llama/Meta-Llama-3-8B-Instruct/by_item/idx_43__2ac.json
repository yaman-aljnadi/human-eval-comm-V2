Will this solution work for very large inputs? (If not, how could you optimize the code)   2. What time complexity is associated with this code?   3. Can we use any built-in functions (like the set function or sum function) in the above code?   4. Is the provided test cases exhaustive?  5. Is the provided docstring accurate?   6. Can you suggest any improvements to code readability or maintainability?   7. Are there any similar problems where we use a similar approach?  8. Would you recommend adding any error handling or validation?   9. Can you explain why the above code has been optimized as it has been?   10. Does the code handle potential edge cases well?  11. Is this solution more space-efficient than others that might be proposed?   12. Could you suggest ways to unit test the code?   13. How would you handle duplicate values in the input list?   14.
