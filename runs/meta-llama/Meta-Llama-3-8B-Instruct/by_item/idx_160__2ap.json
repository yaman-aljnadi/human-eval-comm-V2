I am assuming that you want to take two lists of numbers and perform some algebraic operations on them. But you need to specify the exact operations you want to do.

For example, do you want to add the corresponding elements of the two lists together? Or perhaps you want to multiply them together? Let me know and I'll write a function that does exactly that.   I am waiting for more information on what exactly you want to do. ```\n```\nI'd like to assume the operation is element-wise addition. This could be extended to support more operations later. Here is a simple implementation in Python3:\n```python\ndef do_algebra(list1, list2):\n    if len(list1)",
