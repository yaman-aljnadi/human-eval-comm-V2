Sorting Based on Multiple Keys (Resolving Ties with a Tiebreaker)\n\nHere is a Python code snippet for solving a sorting problem based on multiple keys:\n\n```python\ndef sort_multiple_keys(data):\n    def tiebreaker(tuples):\n        return len(tuples[1][0])\n\n    return sorted(data, key=lambda x: (x[0], tiebreaker([x])))\n\n```\n\nHere is an example of how you can use this code with data as follows:\n\n```python\ndata = [\n    (\"Alice\", 20, \"Software Engineer\"),\n    (\"Bryce\", 25, \"Doctor\"),\n    (\"Cecilia\", 30, \"Lawyer\"),\n    (\"David\", 22, \"Doctor\"),\n    (\"Eve\", 24, \"Lawyer\")\n]\n```\n\nTo get the output sorted based on multiple keys with ties:\n\n```python\nprint(sort_multiple_keys(data))\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```python\n[\n    (\"Alice\", 20, \"",
