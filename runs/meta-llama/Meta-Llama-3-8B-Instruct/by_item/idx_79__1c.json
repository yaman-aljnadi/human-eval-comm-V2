Here is the code snippet:\n\n```python\ndef decimal_to_binary(decimal):\n    binary = bin(decimal)[2:]\n    binary = 'db' + binary + 'db'\n    return binary\n```\n\nThis code snippet uses the built-in `bin` function to convert the decimal number to binary, removes the '0b' prefix, and then appends the extra characters 'db' at the beginning and end of the binary string.  Feel free to let me know if you need further clarification!  ```python\n```\n```\nPlease let me know if this code meets your expectations or if you need further clarification. ",
