So, we fill the buckets (each having a capacity of 1) 3 times.\n- In the second example, each well in the grid contains 3 units of water. So, we fill the buckets (each having a capacity of 2) 1.5 times. Since we cannot fill a fraction of a bucket, we round up to 2.\n- In the third example, each well in the grid contains 3 units of water. So, we fill the buckets (each having a capacity of 5) 0.6 times. Since we cannot fill a fraction of a bucket, we round up to 1. So, we fill 3 buckets.\n\nThis code should give the required output. It simply counts the total water in each well, then divides by the capacity of each bucket and rounds",
