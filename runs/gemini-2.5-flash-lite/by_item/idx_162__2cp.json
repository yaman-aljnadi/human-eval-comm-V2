It takes a `text` string and is expected to return a string `'12345'`.\n\nThe docstring `>>> candidate('Hello world') == '12345'` provides a single test case.\n\n**Clarifying Questions:**\n\n1.  **What is the intended logic of the `candidate` function?** The provided example `candidate('Hello world') == '12345'` implies that the input text `'Hello world'` *should* result in the output `'12345'`.\n    *   Is this a fixed mapping, meaning *any* input string, when passed to `candidate`, should return `'12345'`? This seems unlikely for a function named `candidate` and taking `text` as an argument.\n    *   Is there a specific transformation or rule that transforms `'Hello world'` into `'12345'`? If so, what is that rule? (e.g., length of words, character codes, specific pattern matching, etc.)\n    *   Is the example `>>> candidate('Hello world') == '12345'` an assertion that needs to be *proven true*",
