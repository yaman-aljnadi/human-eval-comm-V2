I've read about using'set' for removing duplicates and using a 'Counter' to find frequencies, so I already have these in my code.\nMy current time complexity for this function is O(n).

Please guide me how I can improve this code, given my constraints.\n\nA: The time complexity of your current function is linear because you iterate over the list only once, in two separate operations. The'set' operation and the 'Counter' operation each need to traverse the entire list. Hence, O(2n).\n\nThe more optimized way to implement this would be to use a dict to count the occurrence of each number and a dict comprehension to build the list. This way you would avoid the need for two separate traversals of the list",
