It initializes a balance to 0 and iterates over the operations, adding each operation to the balance and checking if the balance falls below 0. If it does, the function immediately returns `True`. If the function iterates over all operations without finding a negative balance, it returns `False`.  The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of operations, since it only requires a single pass through the input data. The space complexity is O(1), since it only requires a fixed amount of space to store the balance and iterate over the operations.",
