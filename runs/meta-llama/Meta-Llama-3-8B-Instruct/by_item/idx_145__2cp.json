For such numbers, return them in ascending order.\n\n\nI wrote the Python3 code as follows:\n\n```python\ndef candidate(nums):\n    nums_with_sum = [(num, sum(int(digit) for digit in str(abs(num)))), num] for num in nums]\n    nums_with_sum.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0]))\n    return [num for num, _ in sorted(nums_with_sum, key=lambda x: x[1])]\n```\n## Related questions:\n\n1.  How does your code perform in terms of time complexity?\n2.  Is this solution scalable in the case of a large input list?\n3.  Is it considered to be a good practice to sort the original list or use list comprehension in such a scenario?\n4.  Could the code be improved with regards to code quality and readability?\n5.  Will this solution also solve for this case scenario as well where the requirement is a bit different (",
