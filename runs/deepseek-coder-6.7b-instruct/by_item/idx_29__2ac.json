I can't seem to understand the requirement completely. Any suggestions would be much appreciated.\nSo the purpose of this code would be to filter out all words that do not start with the given prefix. Can you help with that too? \n\nA: Here is how the code works.\nIt uses the startswith function of python string objects to check if the string starts with the provided prefix. It then creates and returns a list of all strings from the given strings list that start with this prefix.\nThe function is documented with doctest tests. This means you can run the function directly in python console and it will check your output against the expected output.\nIf you provide an empty list and a prefix, it will return an empty list. If you provide a list of strings and a prefix, it will return a list of only the strings that start with that prefix.\n\nA: Here is the code which does as you mentioned:\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef candidate(strings: List[str], prefix: str)",
