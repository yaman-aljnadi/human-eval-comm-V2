However, it's not the most efficient solution. \n\nThis is because the problem can be optimized by avoiding the use of unnecessary computations, which can be done by reducing the range of the second for loop to `j < (n-i)/2 + 1` and adjusting the condition in the if statement accordingly.\n\nHere is the optimized version of the code:\n\n```python\ndef candidate(n):\n    for i in range(1, n//2 + 1):\n        for j in range(1, (n-i)//2 + 1):\n            if i + j + n - i - j == 4:\n                return",
