It should return 2 raised to the power of x modulo y. \n\n**Here are some important notes:**\n\n* In all examples provided, you can assume that x is always a non-negative integer and y is always a positive integer. Also, it doesn't matter which of the two is greater.\n* When performing the calculation of 2 raised to the power of x, you should not overflow as 2 raised to a large power can easily exceed the maximum limit of the integer type.\n* When performing the modulo operation, you should be aware of numerics, because the result might be different depending on the order of operations (i.e., which operation is performed first).\n\n**Here is the code I came up with:**\n\n```\ndef candidate(x: int, y: int):\n    if y == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = 1\n    for _ in range(x):\n        result = (result * 2) % y\n    return result\n```\n\n\n\nLet me know if this meets all the requirements and handle edge cases as expected. If not, I will be happy to make adjustments.",
