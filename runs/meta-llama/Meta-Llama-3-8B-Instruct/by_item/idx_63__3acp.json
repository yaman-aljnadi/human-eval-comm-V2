The idea was to use iteration instead of recursion. By storing each intermediate result in memory, I was able to avoid repeated computation. This is much faster than naive recursive approach. \n\n```python\ndef fibfib(n: int):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return 0\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    for _ in range(2, n + 1):\n        a, b = b, a + b\n    return b\n```\n\nI have made a small change to the code to make it more accurate according to the problem description. I noticed that according to the unit tests, fibfib(1) should return 1 not 0. So, I changed the initial values of `a` and `b` to 0 and 1 respectively.\n\nAlso, I noticed that according to the unit tests, fibfib(0",
