This can be done by storing the previously calculated values and using them to calculate the next one. We can take advantage of this property to achieve an efficient solution.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve this problem:\n```\ndef fibfib(n: int):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return 0\n    fibfib_sequence = [0, 0, 1]\n    for i in range(3, n+1):\n        fibfib_sequence.append(fibfib_sequence[i-1] + fibfib_sequence[i-2] + fibfib_sequence[i-3])\n    return fibfib_sequence[n-1]\n```  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | ",
