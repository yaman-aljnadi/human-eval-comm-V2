It first checks if the given sides form a valid triangle, i.e., if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. Then, it uses Heron's formula to calculate the area of the triangle. The area is then rounded off to 2 decimal places and returned as the result.\n\n## Code:\n```python\ndef triangle_area(a, b, c):\n    # Check if sides form a valid triangle\n    if (a + b > c) and (b + c > a) and (c + a > b):\n        # Semi-perimeter\n        s = (a + b + c) / 2\n        # Calculate area using Heron's formula\n        area = (s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c)) ** 0.5\n        return round(area, 2)\n    else:\n        return \"Invalid triangle\"\n\nprint(triangle_area(",
