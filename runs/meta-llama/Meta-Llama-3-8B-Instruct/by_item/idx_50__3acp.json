So, the `candidate` function is supposed to take as input a string decoded or encoded with `encode_shift` function which shifts every character by 5 and then shift it again by 3 to get the original string. In this way, we can simulate a function that shifts every character by 3. Here's the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef candidate(s: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    takes as input string decoded or encoded with encode_shift function which shifts every character by 5.\n    shifts every character by -2 to get the original string.\n    \"\"\"\n    return \"\".join([chr(((ord(ch) - 2 - ord(\"a\")) % 26) + ord(\"a\")) for ch in s])\n```  | \n--  |\n  1. The `candidate` function takes a string `s` as input.\n  2. It iterates over each character in the string.\n  3. For each character, it calculates its ASCII value and subtracts 2 to undo the encoding shift of 5.\n  4. If the result is still greater than the ASCII value of 'z', it subtracts 26 to ensure that the result falls within",
