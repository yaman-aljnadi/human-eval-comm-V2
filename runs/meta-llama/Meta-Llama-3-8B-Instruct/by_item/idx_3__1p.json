It initializes a balance at 0. For each operation, it adds the operation to the balance. If the balance becomes negative, it immediately returns True. If it gets through the entire list without the balance becoming negative, it returns False. In the example given, the code checks whether the balance becomes negative at any point during the given operations. \n   It runs through the operations one by one and whenever it encounters a withdrawal operation (negative number), it subtracts that operation from the",
