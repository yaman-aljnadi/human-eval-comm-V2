My answer for this problem is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef candidate(value):\n    num = float(value)\n    integer_part = int(num)\n    fractional_part = abs(num - integer_part)\n    \n    if fractional_part >= 0.5 or fractional_part == 0.5:\n        if integer_part % 2 == 0:\n            if num < 0:\n                return integer_part - 1\n            else:\n                return integer_part + 1\n        else:\n            return integer_part\n    else:\n        return integer_part\n``` ```\n\n\nThis code assumes the input is a string. It first converts it to a float and separates it into its integer part and fractional part. Then, it checks whether the fractional part is greater than or equal to 0.5, or whether it is exactly 0.5. This determines the rounding behavior. If the fractional part is greater than or equal to 0.5, or if it is exactly 0.5, the code rounds up. Otherwise, it rounds down. It also handles the special cases where the number is equidistant from two integers and needs to be rounded away from zero.",
