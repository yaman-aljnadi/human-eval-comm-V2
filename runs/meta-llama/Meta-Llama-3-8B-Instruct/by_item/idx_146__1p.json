A sequence of consecutive numbers is called a `special sequence` here. For example, if an array contains the numbers [15, -73, 14, -15], there are two sequences of consecutive numbers present (15 and -73,14,-15). We need to return the count of the sequences of consecutive numbers in that array. \n\nIf you need any further clarification, please feel free to ask.\n\n**Respond with Python3 code only in markdown format.**\n```python\n```\n\n```python\ndef specialFilter(nums):\n    nums.sort()\n    result = 0\n    temp = 1\n    for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n        if nums[i] == nums[i-1] + 1:\n            temp += 1\n        else:\n            result += 1 if temp > 1 else 0\n            temp = 1\n    result += 1 if temp > 1 else 0\n    return result\n```  ```python\n```\nLet me know if you have any further questions.
