  "generated_text": "I'm ready to generate the Python3 code for the `double_the_difference` function.\n\nI have reviewed the docstring and examples and believe I understand the requirements. Here's a quick summary to confirm:\n\n*   **Input:** A list of numbers (`lst`).\n*   **Output:** An integer representing the sum of squares.\n*   **Processing:**\n    *   Iterate through each element in the list.\n    *   For each element:\n        *   Check if it's a non-negative integer.\n        *   If it is, check if it's even or odd.\n        *   If it's even or odd (and non-negative integer), square it and add it to a running sum.\n    *   Ignore negative numbers and non-integers.\n    *   If the input list is empty, return 0.\n\nThe examples seem to imply that \"even or odd\" is a redundant condition for integers, as all integers are either even or odd. The core filtering is for \"non-negative\" and \"integer\".\n\nLet me know if there are any nuances I've missed or if you'd like any specific edge cases considered. Otherwise",
