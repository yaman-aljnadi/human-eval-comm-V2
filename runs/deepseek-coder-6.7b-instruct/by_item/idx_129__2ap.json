For this problem, we can treat each cell of the grid as a node and each possible move as an edge. Then we simply apply Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path of length k from a randomly selected starting point.\n\nFirst, you need to set up a graph representation in Python. \n\n```python\nfrom heapq import heappop, heappush\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef shortestPath(grid, k):\n    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0",
