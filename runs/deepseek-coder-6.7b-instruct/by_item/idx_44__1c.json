The str function in python converts an integer to a string, so when you try to add an integer and a string, Python automatically converts the integer to a string so you can perform string concatenation. However, the int type is not able to automatically convert to a string (because it can't be converted), so you'll get a TypeError when you try to do that.\n\nSo, the problem is with line 9:\nreturn change_base(x//base, base) + x%base\n\nReplace it with\nreturn change_base(x//base, base) + str(x%base)\n\nAlso, in Python 3, single quotes (') are used to denote string literals. You used double quotes (\") in your function, which means it's also a string literal in Python syntax. Use only single quotes for string literals.\n\n",
