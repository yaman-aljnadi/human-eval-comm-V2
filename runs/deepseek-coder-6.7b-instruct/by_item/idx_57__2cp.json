This function is meant to return whether the numbers in a list are monotonically increasing or decreasing. My current approach seems correct, but it isn't giving the correct output. \n\nI have attempted to write code in a different format to test my function:\n```python\nprint(candidate([1, 2, 4, 20]))\nprint(candidate([1, 20, 4, 10]))\nprint(candidate([4, 1, 0, -10]))\n```\nBut the expected outputs are all False for the first function call and True for the second. \n\nCan you please let me know where I might be going wrong? Thank you.\n\nA: It seems there",
