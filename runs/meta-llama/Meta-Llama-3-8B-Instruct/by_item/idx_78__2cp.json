Therefore, we can solve this by utilizing the built-in string function `count()`. The count() method in Python returns the number of occurrences of the specified value in the string. We will use it twice, once to count 'E' and once to count 'e'. Then we will add both counts together to return the desired output.```\n\nNote: As an expert developer, you would know the limitations of Python's `int()` function when dealing with large hexadecimal numbers. It is better to handle such situations manually. However, for this specific problem, it is not considered, given the provided examples are relatively small. If the problem description is updated, or you find it necessary, please respond with a new code that handles these limitations.````````` ```*Please respond with code and don't forget to explain your solution in a brief comment!*```*Please respond with code and don't forget to explain your solution in a brief comment!*",
