The first step is to convert the string `s` to lowercase to ensure that the function\n    works regardless of the original case of the string.\n10\n11.  Next, a regular expression pattern is created using the `re.compile()` function.\n    The pattern matches any lowercase or uppercase letters except vowels (both uppercase and lowercase).\n12\n13.  Then, the string `s` is split into a list of words, and a list comprehension is used to\n    filter out words that don't contain any of these consonants and whose length is less\n    than `n`.",
