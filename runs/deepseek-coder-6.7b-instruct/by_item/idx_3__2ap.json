What type of operations are you going to provide as input for the function? It is stated as a list of deposit and withdrawal operations (integers).\n\nCould you provide an example of operations? For example: [-100, 200, -50, 40] might be an example if your operations are in dollars. The first element would be a withdrawal of 100 dollars, then a deposit of 200 dollars, then a withdrawal of 50 dollars and finally a deposit of 40 dollars.\n\nIn this case, the balance would fall below zero after the deposit of 40 dollars, so the function should return True in this case.\n\nA function signature you might use is:\n\ndef below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:\n    pass\n```\n\nA: Thank you for clarifying.\n<jupyter_text",
