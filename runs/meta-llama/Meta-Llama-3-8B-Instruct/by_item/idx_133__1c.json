It rounds each element in the list to the upper int(Ceiling) first using the `math.ceil` function, and then squares each rounded number before summing them up. \n**Functionality tested:** \n* For lst = [1,2,3], the output is indeed 6 (1+4+9).\n* For lst = [1,4,9], the output is indeed 14 (2+8+18).\n* For lst = [1,3,5,7], the output is indeed 16 (4+9+25+49).\n* For lst = [1.4,4.2,0], the output is indeed 5.6 (2.0+17.2+0).\n* For lst = [-2.4,1,1], the output is indeed -0.4 ((-1)^2+1^2+1^2).\n````\n**Functionality tested:** \n* For lst = [1,",
