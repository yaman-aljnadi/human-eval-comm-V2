If the specific order is not specified, it's better to ask for clarification. The code also considers all the numbers (including duplicates) for the sorting check. If we need to consider only distinct numbers, the code needs to be modified accordingly.  \n\n\n\n### Code Explanation (continued)\n\n*   This function takes a list of numbers as input.\n*   It iterates over the list with the index `i` and",
