So the given description is from the task itself. I believe there might be other ways to approach this problem, so please share your code with the best solution.  \n\n\n\n### Code Output:\n```python\ndef pluck(arr):\n    even_nodes = [(x, i) for i, x in enumerate(arr) if type(x) == int and x % 2 == 0]\n    if not even_nodes:\n        return []\n    min_even = min(even_nodes, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))\n    return [min_even[0], min_even[1]]\n```\n\nThis Python3 code defines a function named `pluck` that given an input array, it identifies the node with the smallest even value and its corresponding index, then returns them in a list. If no even values are present in the array or if the array itself is empty, the function returns an empty list. It leverages list comprehension to generate a list of tuples containing both the even node values and their indices, afterwards, it applies the `min` function to find the tuple that has the smallest value. The code's logic follows the",
