You're given two integers, x and y. If the result of subtracting y from x is negative, return the absolute value of that number; otherwise, return the result itself.\nI'm new to Python and I can't understand how to implement this function, but I understand the concept. I'm trying to generate code to implement it.\nI want to use the inbuilt abs function here but I'm having a hard time understanding how to use it.\nThe absolute value function in Python could be helpful here, as it takes a number and returns its absolute value.\nPlease help me with this.\nThank you.\n\nA: The abs() function in Python takes a single number and returns the absolute value of the number. Absolute value means converting the number into a positive number if it is negative.\nTo achieve this functionality in your function, you could use the built-in abs() function:\ndef candidate(x: int, y: int):\n    return abs(x - y)\nHere is how",
