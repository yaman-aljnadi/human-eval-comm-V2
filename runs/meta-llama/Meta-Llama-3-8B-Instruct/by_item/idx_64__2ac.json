I will add some test cases based on my understanding of your problem statement. Here are some additional test cases:\n\nTest cases:\n\n1. Test the function with different types of inputs: string, int, float\n2. Test the function with valid and invalid inputs (invalid input should return an error message or exception)\n3.
