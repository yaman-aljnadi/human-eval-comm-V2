Or something else entirely? Or do we need to consider both scenarios?\n\nI think we should consider both scenarios because both conditions have been mentioned in the original prompt. We cannot rule out either scenario without further clarification. Hence, I'll be asking clarifying questions to ensure we understand the problem correctly. Below are my questions:\n\n1. Are we looking for the n-th Prime number or the n-th Fibonacci number?\n2. Is there any relation between Prime numbers and Fibonacci numbers in this problem, or are they separate conditions?\n3. Are there any specific rules or constraints that govern the relationship between Prime numbers and Fibonacci numbers, if applicable? \n\n\n\n\n\n(Please respond with code or ask clarifying questions in the comments.)\n\n\nThank you!  :))  ):\n\n\n\n**Update**\n\nI misunderstood the prompt initially. The problem is about generating the n-th Prime number. Please disregard my previous questions about Fibonacci numbers. \n\n\n\n\n\nSo, in Python3, below is the code for the candidate function:\n\n```\ndef candidate(n: int):\n    primes = []\n    num = 2\n    while len(primes) < n:\n        if all(num % p >",
