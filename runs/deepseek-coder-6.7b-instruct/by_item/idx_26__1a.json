What can be done to make this code more efficient?\n\nA: One possible optimization could be made by moving the second loop to directly after the first one. This way, you are not looping over the entire list twice, but rather loop over it once and perform the necessary operations for both counting and checking the occurrence. Also, it could benefit from using list comprehension instead of regular loops.\n\nHere is how to make these adjustments:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef candidate(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    count = {n: numbers.count(n) for n in numbers}\n    return [n for n in numbers if count[n] == 1]\n```\n\nThis code does the same thing, but it uses",
