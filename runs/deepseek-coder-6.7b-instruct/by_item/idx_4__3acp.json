The calculation of MAD is pretty straightforward:\n\n    MAD = mean(abs(X - mean(X)))\n\nSo, for example:\n\n    nums = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]\n    mean = sum(nums) / len(nums)  # mean = 2.5\n    abs_diffs = [abs(num - mean) for num in nums]  # abs_diffs = [1.5, 1.0, 1.5, 1.5]\n    mad = sum(abs_diffs) / len(abs_diffs)  # mad = 1.5\n\nWhat I am asking for is how could this be implemented in Python code. I tried to implement this using a few methods, but was unsuccessful.\n\nA: You can use Python's built-in statistics module to calculate the mean and median. The function statistic.mean() can be used to calculate the mean. Then we can",
