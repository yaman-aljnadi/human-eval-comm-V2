What is the most efficient and Pythonic way to do this?  For example, given the word \"yacht\", the character 'y' at the end of the word should be considered a vowel.  However, if the word is \"my\", then 'y' is not a vowel.  I understand that typically in a word, 'y' is not a vowel unless it is preceded by another vowel.  However, in my case, 'y' is a vowel if it is at the end of a word, regardless of whether it was preceded by another vowel or not.  So how do I check this in Python?\n\nI am having trouble understanding how to check if a character is at the end of a string in Python.  I have seen some examples of checking for the last character in a string, but I am not sure how to incorporate this into my existing code.  Can someone please help me understand how to do this in Python?  Thank you very much for your time and assistance.\n\n\"\"\"\n\n## I will keep the information below as",
