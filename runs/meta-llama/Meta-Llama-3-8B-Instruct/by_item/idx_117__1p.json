If no such words exist, an empty list should be returned.\n\n**Example**:\n    - s = \"apple and banana and orange\"\n    - n = 2\n    - Output: [\"and banana\", \"and orange\"]\n\n\n```python\ndef select_words(s, n):\n    words = s.split()\n    result = []\n    for i in range(len(words)):\n        word =''.join(words[i:i+n])\n        if len(set(word.split())) == n:\n            result.append(word)\n    return result\n```  |  This is the answer. It's a python function called select_words that takes two parameters s and n. It splits the input string into words, then loops through the words. It constructs a sub-string by joining words from the original string. It checks if the sub-string contains exactly 'n' unique words by comparing the number of unique words",
