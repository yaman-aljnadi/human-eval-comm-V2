It first checks if `n` is 1, and if so, returns 3 as per the recurrence relation. Then, it checks if `n` is even or odd and applies the relevant recurrence relation accordingly. I also used the division operator `/` for floating point division to ensure the correct results for non-integer inputs. You can try out",
