You correctly identified a pair of brackets as balanced when you encounter them. So your function is already correct.\nBut to add a bit of complexity, let's create a balanced brackets for more than one type of brackets and for not only \"<\" and \">\" but also \"{}\", \"[]\", \"()\" and \"<>\":\n```",
