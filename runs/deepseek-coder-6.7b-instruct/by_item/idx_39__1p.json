Especially in the fibonacci and candidate function. If there are functions that I need to define, let me know. Include any assumptions you made about the input. \n\nThanks a lot. I'm really looking forward to your reply.\n\nA: This code takes an integer `n` as an input. It first defines a function `fibon",
