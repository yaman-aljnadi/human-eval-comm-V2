Each string in `lst` contains only digits (e.g., \"12345\", \"802\", \"7\").\n3.  For *each* string in the input list, you need to count how many of the *digits within that string* are odd.\n4.

The count is 3.\n*   For `\"802\"`: There are no odd digits. The count is 0.\n*   For `\"7\"`: The odd digit is 7. The count is ",
