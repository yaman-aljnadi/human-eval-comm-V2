Is there a way to fix this issue without changing the functionality of the code, i.e., without moving markdown headers or changing the current functionality of the code?\n\nA: No, it's not possible to compile and execute Python code directly in the documentation in this state without modifying the functionality of the code. Markdown headers, including the one you provided, will cause an error because Python is expecting docstrings, or comment-like syntax, not headers.\n\nThe error may come from the fact that when you run these methods from an interactive Python shell or from a Jupyter notebook kernel, they run fine because most Python environments handle docstring syntax by default. \n\nHowever, to address this, you could fix the docstrings to be regular comments without the triple-quotes, or use a different format to write comments if you want your Markdown in these docstrings.
