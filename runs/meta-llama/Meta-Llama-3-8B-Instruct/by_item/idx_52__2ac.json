Here is the Python3 code that should fulfill your request. \n```python\ndef candidate(l, t):\n    return any(t/5 <= x <= t for x in l) or t in l\n``` \nLet me know if you have any clarifying questions. Or, I can adjust the code if your interpretation of \"around threshold t\" is slightly different.  If you want to relax the threshold by more than 20% or adjust the condition, we can further discuss. \n\nThank you for your patience!  - [Your Name]  - [Your Expertise]  -  [Your LinkedIn Profile]  - [Your GitHub Profile]  -  [Your Email Address]  -  [Your Bio]  -  [Your Picture]  -  [Your Company Name]  -  [Your Location]  -  [Your Phone Number]  -  [Your Portfolio]  -  [Your Skills]  -  [Your Certifications]  -  [Your Testimonials]  -  [Your Awards]  -  [",
