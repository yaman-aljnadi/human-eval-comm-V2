Does the order of lexicographical order matter for words with the same number of unique characters? \n2. Can the input list be empty? If so, what should the function return? \n\n### Note\nThe code will run perfectly fine in Python 3.6 and above. For Python 3.5 or below, it will still work, but please be aware that the dictionary is unordered data structure. \n```python\n```\n* * *\n\nNote that Python 3.5 and above will prioritize lexicographical order. Python 3.4 and below might return a different result for words with the same number of unique characters, but in lexicographical order. You can consider asking clarifying questions to ensure your output matches the desired outcome. For this code, I have used a generator expression to efficiently iterate through the list of words. If the input list is very large, consider using other",
