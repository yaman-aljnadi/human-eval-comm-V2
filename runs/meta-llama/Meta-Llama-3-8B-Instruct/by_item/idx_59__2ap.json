Assume n > 1 and is not a prime.\n    \"\"\"\n\n\n### Question Clarification \n\nWhat exactly do you mean by \"smallest or largest prime factor\" in context of this problem? I understand the terms, but I'm not sure what you're asking me to do.\n\nAre you asking me to \n\n-   Find both the smallest and the largest prime factors, \n-   Determine whether the smallest prime factor is less than or greater than half of n, and then return the smallest one (or largest one if smaller), \n-   Return the prime factor with the maximum absolute difference from n itself (i.e., for example, if n is 36, you would return 3 because it has the largest absolute difference from 36 which is 33)?\n\nLet me know if my understanding is correct, or if I need to clarify further! \n```python\n```\n\nPlease respond with your code or further clarification questions. Thank you for your help.  Best regards,  Rohan.  Please respond directly with code and explain your code. \n```python\n```\npython\n```python\ndef candidate(n: int):\n    def is_prime(num: int):\n        if num < 2:\n            return False\n        for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):\n",
