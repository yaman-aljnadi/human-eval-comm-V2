The input list, xs, always contains at least one coefficient.\n2. All coefficients are numbers (integers or floats).\n3. The polynomial's degree (highest power of x) is equal to the length of xs minus 1 (since the constant term does not have an x in its power).\n4. In the output, the constant term is the derivative of the constant term, the first term (i.e., degree 1 term) is the derivative of the first degree term, and so on.\n\n**Answer:**\n```python\ndef derivative(xs: list):\n    return [i * x for i, x in enumerate(xs[1:])]\n\n``` ```python\ndef derivative(xs: list):\n    return [i * x for i, x in enumerate(xs[1:])]\n\n``` 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 5 4 3 2 1 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 5 4 3 2 1 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 5 4 3 2 1 0 0 1 2 3 ",
