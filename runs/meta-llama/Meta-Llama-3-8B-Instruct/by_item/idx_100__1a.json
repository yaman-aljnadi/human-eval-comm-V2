Thank you.  This problem is from CodeForces.  The question is asking for the number of stones in each level when we make a pile of 2*n or n levels of stones. The first level has n stones. The number of stones in the next level is the next odd number if n is odd and the next even number if n is even.   For example, if n is 3, the output should be [3, 5, 7].   ```\nI'd be happy to help. Before generating the code, I'd like to ask a clarifying question. How do we determine the \"next odd number\" or \"next even number\" in this problem? For example,",
