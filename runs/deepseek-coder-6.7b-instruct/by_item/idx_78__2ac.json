You've been asked to implement a function that counts the occurrence of the following digits in a number of a given base (hexadecimal, octal, or another base): 2, 3, 5, 7, B(=11), D(=13).\n2. Digits of other bases can be supported via base conversion.\n3. B, C, D are prime numbers but also are other digits in hexadecimal representation.\n4. Your task involves writing a python function that performs this action.\n5. You need to count only those digits.\n6. You need to return only the count.\n\nAnd here's how this would look in Python:\n\n```python\ndef candidate(num):\n    prime_set = set('2357BCD')\n    return sum(num.count(digit) for digit in prime_set)\n```\n\n",
