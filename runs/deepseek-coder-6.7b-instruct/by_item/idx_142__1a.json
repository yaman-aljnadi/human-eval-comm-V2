Is there a better way to write the function?\n\nA: Your code could be re-written as follows to make it more efficient:\n\n```python\ndef sum_squares(lst):\n    return sum(val**2 if idx % 3 == 0 or idx % 4 == 0 else val for idx, val in enumerate(lst))\n```\n\nHere, instead of using a loop, we're using a generator expression with the `sum` function, which might be more memory efficient for large inputs, and results in fewer computations.
