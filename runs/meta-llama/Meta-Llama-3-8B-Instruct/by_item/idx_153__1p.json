Can someone help with a test case or confirm that this is correct?\n\n```\ndef Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):\n    max_strength = float('-inf')\n    chosen_extension = None\n\n    for extension in extensions:\n        extension_strength = sum(1 for char in extension if char.isupper()) - sum(1 for char in extension if char.islower())\n        if extension_strength > max_strength:\n            max_strength = extension_strength\n            chosen_extension = extension\n    return f\"{class_name}_{chosen_extension}\"\n```\n\n\n\n**My attempt for the output of this function:**\n\nIf class_name is 'Robot' and extensions are ['Upper', 'lower', 'Mix'], I would expect output to be 'Robot_Upper'.  This is because Upper has the maximum strength, among the given extensions, as the ratio of uppercase letters to lowercase letters is 2 to 0.\n\nCan someone please confirm if my code is correct or not? and tell me if there is any way to improve the existing code?  I am especially concerned about the code's complexity, performance and maintainability. \n\nThank you in advance! \n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]  # Please fill your name here.",
