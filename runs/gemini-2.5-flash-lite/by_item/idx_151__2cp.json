It starts by saying \"return the sum of squares of the numbers in the list that are\" and then the examples seem to indicate that it's returning the sum of squares of numbers that are *not* divisible by 3. However, the function name `double_the_difference` doesn't immediately suggest this behavior.\n\nTo provide you with the best Python code, please clarify the intended logic:\n\n1.  **What is the specific condition for including a number in the sum of squares?**\n    *   Is it numbers that are *not* divisible by 3?\n    *   Is it numbers that are *not* divisible by some other number?\n    *   Is it something else entirely related to \"doubling the difference\"?\n\n2.  **How does the name `double_the_difference` relate to the examples and the intended logic?** If the logic is indeed based on divisibility by 3, the function name is quite misleading.\n\nOnce I have this clarification, I can provide the correct Python code.",
