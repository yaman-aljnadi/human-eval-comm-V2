This is a solution, so please don't suggest any changes to it.\n\nA: The given function is already at its simplest form for this kind of problem. There are no loops or recursions to iterate over and no complex arithmetics to calculate. \n\nOnly checking if remaining carrots are more than the need or not, and if yes then calculate total carrots and return that along with remaining carrots as per the need, else return total carrots and remaining as 0.\n\nThis is the simplest solution possible considering this problem, there are no further optimisations possible, as per the constraints",
