The function should also handle cases where the target value does not exist in the list.\n\nExample:\n\nInput: candidate([1,2,3,2,1], 2)\nOutput: [1,3,1]\n\nHint: The target value in this case is 2. And the output is a new list with all occurrences of 2 removed.  |\n\n\n---\n\nI can handle this in the following way:\n\n```\ndef candidate(l: list, target_value):\n    \"\"\"Return elements in a list without a target value\n    \"\"\"\n    return [element for element in l if element!= target_value]\n```\n\nSo, what do you think?  Can I have your feedback please?  \n\n\n\n--- \n\nLet me first say that your code is completely correct and works fine. However,  I want to suggest a few ways to improve it. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. You could add type hints for the parameters of the function. The current implementation assumes that `l` is a list and `target_value` is also a single element. You could add these",
