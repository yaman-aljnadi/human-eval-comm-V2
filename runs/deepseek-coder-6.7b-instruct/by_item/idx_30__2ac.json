I know how to do it with just positive numbers and I found this code for that:\n\n    result = [num for num in l if num > 0]\n    return result\n\nBut I'm not sure what modification to apply in order to include the condition of also having numbers less than or equal to 0. Any suggestions?\n\"\"\"\nI need to modify the code to include 0 and negative numbers\nSo, I tried updating the condition as follows:\n\n```python\n    result = [num for num in l if num >=0]\n    return result\n```\n\nBut it's not yielding the correct results. What am I missing?\n\"\"\"\n\nA: The code is almost correct, the issue is with your comparison operator. You're currently using \">\", which checks if a number is greater than 0. You want to include numbers that are greater than or equal to 0, so you need to change that",
