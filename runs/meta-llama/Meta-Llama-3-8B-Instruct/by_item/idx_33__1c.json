It sorts in ascending order, which, according to the provided test cases, seems to be what is intended. However, this is not explicitly stated in the problem description. If this was not intended, please clarify what type of sorting is required. Also, consider what should happen if the sorted list contains duplicate elements and the original list also contains duplicates at the indices divisible by 3. For example, consider what the output should be for input list `[5, 6, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2]`. Should all duplicates be preserved, or is one arbitrary instance of the duplicated element allowed in the output? If the latter, which one should be preserved? If all, should all duplicates be kept in the sorted portion of the output list as well?  Let me know if I'm missing something. \n\nLastly, the provided unit tests are not exhaustive. Additional unit tests may be needed",
