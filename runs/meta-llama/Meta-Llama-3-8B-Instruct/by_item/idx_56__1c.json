If other characters are also allowed, an additional check should be added to ignore those characters. For simplicity, I have left that part as it is in the given problem. Also, this code counts both \"<\" and \">\" together, it does not matter if there are more of one or the other, as long as there are no unbalanced pairs. The opening and closing pairs of brackets must match exactly. For example, if there are 3 opening brackets, there must be 3 closing brackets in a perfectly matching manner.  It will return True if the brackets are in perfect matching pairs and False otherwise. It can correctly identify the given test cases in the problem statement.   ```python\n```python\ndef correct_bracketing(brackets: str):\n    opening = 0\n    for bracket in brackets:\n        if bracket == \"<\":\n            opening += 1\n",
