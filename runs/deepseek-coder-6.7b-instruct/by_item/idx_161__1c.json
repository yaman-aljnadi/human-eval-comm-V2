If it contains letters, we swap their cases using the `swapcase()` method and join them together. If it doesn't contain any letters, we reverse the string using slicing `[::-1]`.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n```python\nprint(solve(\"1234\"))  # \"1234\"\nprint(solve(\"ab\"))  # \"ab\"\nprint(solve(\"#a@C\"))  # \"#A@c\"\n```\n\nIn these examples, `#a@C` turned into `#A",
