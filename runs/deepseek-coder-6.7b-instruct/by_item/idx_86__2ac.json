Your explanation is clear and your code is understandable. I'm excited to see what else you can create.\n\nPossible Improvements:\n\n1. The current implementation is case-sensitive. If you want it to be case-insensitive, you need to convert the string to lower or upper case before you sort.\n\n2. You should also consider punctuation (spaces, periods, commas, exclamation points etc.) as characters in your string.",
