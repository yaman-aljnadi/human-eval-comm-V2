It avoids using recursion by manually updating the values. The loop starts from `n=3`, since we already have the base cases for `n=0`, `n=1` and `n=2`. For each iteration, we update the `a`, `b`, `c` and `d` variables to represent the next 4 numbers in the sequence. The `d` variable will hold the value of the `n`-th element in the sequence. The function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the corresponding value in the Fib4 sequence. \n\nThis approach has a time complexity of O(n) and uses a constant amount of",
