However, there seems to be a missing condition/parameter `n` in the original function definition. It seems that `a`, `b`, and `c` are not directly related to the return values.\n\nCould you please provide more context or details about how `a`, `b`, and `c` are used in this function, or what kind of number `n` represents?\n\nAlso, I'd like to clarify, is `n` always a single number or could it be a collection of numbers or other types of objects? \n\nLastly, are there any specific edge cases or conditions that need to be considered while implementing this function?\n\nPlease let me know if this is a correct understanding of the problem. If so, I can try to provide a Python3 code snippet. If not, please",
