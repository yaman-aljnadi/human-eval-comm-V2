The code below is used to count the parentheses in a string. It starts counting when it encounters an open parenthesis and ends counting when it encounters a close parenthesis.\n\n```python\ndef candidate(paren_string: str) -> List[int]:\n    result = []\n    stack = []\n    for char in paren_string:\n        if char == '(':\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char == ')':\n            if stack:\n                result.append(len(stack))\n                stack.pop()\n            else:\n                raise ValueError(\"Unmatched closing parenthesis\")\n    return result\n```\n\n\nIf the group is empty (i.e., no parentheses were found in the group), a value of 0 should be returned. \n\nThis revised code will handle edge cases and will not return any value if there is an unmatched closing parenthesis. \n\nAlso, the revised code will return a value for each group in the string,",
