Do you need any additional clarification on the problem description? If yes, please ask the clarifying questions. If not, I'll respond directly with Python3 code. Please advise accordingly. Thank you.]]\n\n\nI will respond directly with Python code. Here is a solution using Python 3:\n\n```python\ndef double_the_difference(lst):\n    if not lst:\n        return 0\n    return sum([i ** 2 for i in lst if i % 2 == 0])\n```\nThis solution checks for an empty list first and returns 0. If the list is not empty, it uses a list comprehension to generate a new list of squares of numbers in the original list that are divisible by 2, then returns the sum of those squares using the built-in `sum` function.]]|Rated 5\n**@Praveen**|\n**Rating: 5 (Outstanding)**|\n**Date: 2023-03-27T10:16:35+00:00**|\n**Text:** Very good explanation. Thank you for your time and efforts. Your Python3 code works perfectly fine. The additional clarification you asked was very helpful. Good work. I will certainly come back to",
