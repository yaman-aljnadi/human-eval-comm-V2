It says, there are 5 distinct characters in \"candide\", and I am getting 7, and I don't know why, because \"d\" appears twice in the word \"candide\". The output is 7, not 5. \n\nHow is this possible?\n\nCould you please clarify?\n\nI don't know how this misunderstanding could have occurred. How do I fix this?\n\n\nThank you.\n\nI also tried to run this in Python interactive shell and I get the same result. When I pass \"candide\" as an argument to the function, I should be getting 5, but instead I am getting 7.\n\nI have",
