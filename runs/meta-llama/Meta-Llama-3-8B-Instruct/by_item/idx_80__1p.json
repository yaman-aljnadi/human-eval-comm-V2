And what changes should i do to get a better output? Thanks a lot! \n\n# Explanation\n\nExplanation provided with the code:\nThe task is to find whether a given string contains repeating characters or not. \n\nSo, I took an idea from a similar problem where I used set() to remove duplicate characters and then compared the length of the original string with that of the set. If both are equal, it means there are no repeating characters in the string, so we can say it is a happy string.\n\nAnd the function will return a boolean value. If all characters are unique, then we return True (it's a happy string), otherwise, we return False. It works for both uppercase and lowercase letters as set() in Python doesn't differentiate between uppercase and",
