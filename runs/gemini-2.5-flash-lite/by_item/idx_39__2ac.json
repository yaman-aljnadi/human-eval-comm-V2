  "generated_text": "Given the information, the provided doctests are inconsistent with the description of the `candidate` function. The doctests suggest the function is returning multiples of 10 (20, 30, 50, 130, 890), while the description states it should return the n-th number that is *both* a Fibonacci number and prime or composite.\n\nA number that is both a Fibonacci number and prime or composite is simply *any* Fibonacci number greater than 1 (since 0 and 1 are neither prime nor composite by standard definitions). If this is the case, the doctests are entirely incorrect.\n\nTo generate high-quality code, I need to clarify the exact requirement.\n\n**Clarifying Questions:**\n\n1.  **What is the intended relationship between Fibonacci numbers and the numbers returned by `candidate`?**\n    *   Are the returned numbers supposed to be Fibonacci numbers that are *also* prime? (This would imply finding Fibonacci primes).\n    *   Are the returned numbers supposed to be Fibonacci numbers that are *also* composite? (This would imply finding Fibonacci composites).\n    *   Are the returned numbers supposed to be Fibonacci numbers that are *either* prime *or*",
