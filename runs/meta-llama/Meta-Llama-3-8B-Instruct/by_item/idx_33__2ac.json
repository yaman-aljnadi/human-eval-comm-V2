Based on the description you provided, I understand that you want a function that sorts the elements in a list at indices that are multiples of 3 in ascending order, while keeping all other elements in their original order.  Here is a possible Python implementation:\n```\ndef candidate(l: list):\n    return [x if i%3!=0 else sorted([x])[::-1] for i, x in enumerate(l)]\n```\nLet me know if this is what you were looking for.
