  "generated_text": "The docstring for `unique_digits(x)` is a bit ambiguous. It says \"return a sorted list of all elements that hasn't any\". This could be interpreted in a few ways:\n\n1.  **Elements with unique digits:** Return numbers where all their digits are distinct (e.g., 123, 4567).\n2.  **Elements with *no* repeated digits:** This is the same as interpretation 1.\n3.  **Elements that *don't have* a specific property:** The phrasing \"hasn't any\" is unusual. It might be a typo and intended to be \"hasn't any *repeated* digits\".\n\nGiven the function name `unique_digits`, the most probable intention is to find numbers where all their constituent digits are unique.\n\nTo clarify, could you please confirm if the function should:\n\n*   **Return numbers where each digit within the number is unique (e.g., 123, 901)?**\n*   **Or does \"hasn't any\" refer to something else entirely?**\n\nOnce this is clarified, I can provide the Python3 code.",
