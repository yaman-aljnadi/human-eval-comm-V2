The `grid` is a 2D list representing the wells, where 0 represents an empty well and 1 represents a well filled with water. The `capacity` argument represents the volume of water that each bucket can hold. The function's objective is to determine the maximum number of times the buckets need to be lowered to empty the wells completely.\n\nIn this code, we first calculate the total amount of water present in the wells by summing up all the 1s in the 2D grid. We then use the `math.ceil` function to determine how many buckets with a",
