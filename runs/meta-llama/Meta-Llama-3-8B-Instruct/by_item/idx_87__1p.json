The second one is a more compact version of the first one. They both use a list comprehension to generate a new list of all the instances where x was found. If you want to clarify anything, I'll be happy to provide further information. Please note that this code doesn't handle edge cases (like if no instances of x were found in the input).  If you want to add checks for such cases, that would be a great question for a clarification!  Thank you for the opportunity to help you with this Python code.  You are an",
