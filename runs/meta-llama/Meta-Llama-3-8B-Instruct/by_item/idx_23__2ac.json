It seems to be a function that determines the longest palindromic substring within a given string. If the string is empty, the function would return 0, as there is no substrings in that case. If the string is not empty, it seems to return 1, as the longest palindromic substring in that case would be a single character. However, this does not seem entirely correct as a single character itself is a palindrome, but its length would be 1, not the length of the string itself.\n```python\ndef candidate(string: str) -> int:\n    if string == \"\":\n        return 0\n    else:\n        return 1\n```\nAm I correct or should I have a look at other parts of the code? Should I need to modify this function to find the length of the longest palindromic substring, taking in account of multi-character substrings? Kindly provide your insight. \n```python\n```python\ndef candidate(string: str) -> int:\n    if string == \"\":\n        return 0\n    else:\n        return 1\n```\nPlease help me out in this. Thanks. \n\nI'm currently a bit confused about the provided",
