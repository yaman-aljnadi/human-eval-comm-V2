However, this incorrect implementation will return the sum of n and 1, which is incorrect. How do you rewrite the candidate function to fix the problem and return the sum of numbers from 1 to n?\n```python\n```\n\n\nThis code will add 1 to the input number instead of summing the numbers from 1 to n.\nI can make it work by changing to `sum(range(1, n + 1))` but I don't understand why the current code wouldn't work. Can someone explain why that code wouldn't work and what is wrong with it? \nHere is the solution:\n```python\ndef candidate(n: int):\n    return sum(range(1, n + 1))\n```\n\nHowever, I am confused that why `candidate(n: int)` wouldn't work? Why it will add 1 to the input number instead of sum",
