This function accepts two positive numbers, `x` and `y`. It first checks if `x` is greater than `y`, in which case it returns `-1`. This is the base case where `x` is larger than `y`.\n2. If `x` is even, it returns `x`.\n3. Finally, if both `x` and `y` are either odd or `x` is odd and `y` is even, `y` is returned.\n\nA code could look like:\n```python\ndef choose_num(x, y):\n    if x > y:\n        return -1\n    elif x % 2 == 0:\n        return x\n    elif y % 2 == 0:\n        return y\n    else:\n        return x\n```\nThis code does the same thing, but handles two different cases of `x` and `y` being even differently. \n\nThe `else",
