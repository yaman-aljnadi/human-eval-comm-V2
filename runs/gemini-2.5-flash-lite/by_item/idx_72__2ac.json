  "generated_text": "This problem statement has a few ambiguities. I need some clarification before I can write the code.\n\n**Clarifying Questions:**\n\n1.  **\"balanced (it is a palindromic list)\"**: This part is clear. A palindromic list reads the same forwards and backward.\n2.  **\"the sum of its elements is more than or less than or equal the weight w.\"**: This is where the ambiguity lies. The example `will_it_fly([1, 2], 5) ➞ True` states:\n    > `# 1+2 is less than the maximum possible weight, but it's unbalanced.`\n\n    However, the description says \"The object q will fly if it's balanced... **and** the sum of its elements is more than or less than or equal the weight w.\" The word \"and\" suggests both conditions must be met for `True`. The example's explanation seems to contradict this by saying `True` even though it's unbalanced.\n\n    Could you please clarify the exact logic for when `will_it_fly` should return `True`? Specifically:\n    *   Is the object `q` *only* able to fly if it's",
