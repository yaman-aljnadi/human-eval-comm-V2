If the input string and the substring itself are of the same length, would we still consider this as a match?\n2. If there's more than one occurrence of the substring in the string, do we care about other occurrences besides the first one? \n3. Are there any specific constraints or limitations on string characters? For example, are these strings comprised only of ASCII characters, or can there be non-ASCII characters as well?\n```python\n```  # This is where your python3 code should be placed.\n```\n```\n\n\n```python\n```\n```python\n```\n\n#### Example 2:\n\n```python\na = \"hellohello\"\nb = \"hello\"\nOutput: 1\n```\n\n####",
