It gives'str' object is not callable error.\nAny help with coding this or if you need more clarification, please, let me know. \n\nA: Your functions seems correct and should work perfectly fine in Python3. This is Python3 code that does nothing but call the encode_cyclic function with the input \"12345\" and prints the result:\n```python\nprint(candidate(\"12345\"))\n```\nWhat you get is \"23451\" because \"12345\" is passed to encode_cyclic function and then printed.
