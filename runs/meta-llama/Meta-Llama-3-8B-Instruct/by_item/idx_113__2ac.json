Let me know if you have any further questions or need further clarification. Thank you. \n1. If there is only one input string, it does not matter which string it refers to.  \n2. The code doesn't handle multi-element input strings correctly. It seems to treat the whole string as a single element.  \n3. I've used f-strings for string formatting, Python 3.6 or later is required.  \n4. I've made assumptions based on the provided unit tests. Please review them to confirm. \n\nLet me know if my code is missing any important requirements. If so, I'll be happy to assist you in making adjustments. Thank you. ```python\n\n``` ```python\n\nI apologize for my previous misunderstanding. I will",
