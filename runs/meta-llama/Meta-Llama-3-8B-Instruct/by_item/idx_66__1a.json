Based on the provided examples, it seems that 'non-upper characters' are all characters that are not upper characters. \n- However, the term 'non-upper characters' itself does not clearly define what characters are to be considered as 'non-upper characters'. If we have a string containing both upper characters and non-upper characters, but the same character appears in both these two categories, then it should be counted twice. \n",
