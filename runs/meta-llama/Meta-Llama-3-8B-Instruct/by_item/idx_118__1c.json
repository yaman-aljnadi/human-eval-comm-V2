If it finds a vowel, it then iterates through the word again from the right, checking for the first pair of non-vowels (i.e., the two consonants on either side of the closest vowel) and returns the character at the beginning of that pair. If no pair of non-vowels is found, the code returns an empty string. \n\nIf there's any confusion or need further explanation, please let me know and I'll try to clarify further! \n\nThanks!  üêß```python\n``` \n\n### # \n\n####  How about the other options? #Python\n```python\ndef get_closest_vowel(word):\n    word = word.lower()\n    left = 0\n    for",
