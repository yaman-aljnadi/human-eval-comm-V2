  "generated_text": "Based on the provided function signature and docstrings, it seems there might be a misunderstanding of how base conversion typically works, especially with the given examples.\n\nThe docstrings show:\n*   `change_base(8, 3)` returns `'8'`\n*   `change_base(8, 2)` returns `'8'`\n*   `change_base(7, 2)` returns `'7'`\n\nThis suggests that the function is *not* performing a standard base conversion where a number is represented in a different numerical system (e.g., 8 in base 10 to its representation in base 3, which would be '22'). Instead, it appears to be returning the input number as a string *only if* the digits of the input number are less than the target base. If any digit of the input number is greater than or equal to the target base, it seems to return the original number as a string without conversion.\n\nThis is an unusual interpretation of \"change numerical base.\" A typical base conversion would handle numbers larger than the target base by performing the conversion.\n\n**To provide you with the most accurate and useful code, I need clarification on the intended behavior:**\n\n**Clarifying Questions:**",
