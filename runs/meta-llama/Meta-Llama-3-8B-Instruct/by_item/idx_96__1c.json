There is no need for further clarifications or code. The code provided can be directly used. It is already optimal for the problem at hand. It checks each number below 'n' for primality and appends those that are prime to the result list. For large values of 'n', other methods like Sieve or memoization could be considered for better performance. However, for this specific problem,",
