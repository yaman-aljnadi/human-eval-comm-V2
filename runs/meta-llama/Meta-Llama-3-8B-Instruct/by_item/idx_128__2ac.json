The corresponding signs of the numbers in the array are determined as follows:\n\n- If the sign of a number is positive (i.e., the number is greater than 0), then its corresponding sign is 1.\n- If the sign of a number is negative (i.e., the number is less than 0), then its corresponding sign is -1.\n- If the sign of a number is 0 (i.e., the number is equal to 0), then its corresponding sign is 0.\n\nThe function should return None for an empty array.\n\nHere's a simple implementation of this function in Python:\n\n    ```python\n    def candidate(arr):\n        signs = [1 if x > 0 else -1 if x < 0 else 0 for x in arr]\n        if not arr:\n            return None\n        return sum(abs(x) for x in arr if signs[arr.index(x)] == 1)\n    ```\n\nIn this code, we first generate a list of signs based on",
