Thank you for your time!  |  Asked on December 13, 2021 |\n17 views |\n\n#### 3 Comments\n#### Top Answer\nHere is the Python code to solve this problem:\n```\ndef rounded_avg(n, m):\n    if n > m:\n        return -1\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(n, m+1):\n        sum += i\n    rounded_avg = round(sum / (m - n + 1))\n    binary_avg = format(rounded_avg, 'b')\n    return str(binary_avg)\n```\nPlease test it! |  Accepted Answer   |  Score: 5 |  Asked on December 13, 2021 |  #### 1 Reply\n### 1 Reply\nI have also used another method by using the sum function and its lambda function, it's more concise and easier to read. You can see the code below:\n\n```\ndef rounded_avg(n, m):\n    if n > m:\n        return -1\n    sum = sum(range(n, m+1))\n    rounded_avg = round(sum / (m - n",
