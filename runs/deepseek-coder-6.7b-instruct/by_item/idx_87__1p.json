So each element in your \"sub\" list is a row in the matrix.\nThen in the list comprehension, you loop through your input \"lst\", and for each \"sub\", you are checking if \"x\" is in that \"sub\". The function enumerate is used to get the index of each \"sub\" in \"lst\".\nLet's write the code:\n```python\ndef get_row(lst, x):\n    row = [i for i",
