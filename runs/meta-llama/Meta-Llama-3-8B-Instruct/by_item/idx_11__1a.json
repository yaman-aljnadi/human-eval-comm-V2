Happy coding!  \n\n\n\nPlease let me know if I'm correct or not.  \n\n\n\nUpdate:\n\nI found a problem in my code. The function does not correctly return the bitwise XOR operation as per the given examples. My apologies for the confusion.\n\nHere's the new code that will correctly return the bitwise XOR operation:\n\n```python\ndef candidate(a: str, b: str) -> str:\n    return ''.join(str(int(c1) ^ int(c2)) for c1, c2 in zip(a, b))\n```\nI hope this new code meets your requirements.  If you still need modifications, please don't hesitate to ask.  Thank you for pointing out the mistake! ",
