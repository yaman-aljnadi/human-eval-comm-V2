I have been programming for quite a long time. I can understand Python pretty well. I can do a lot of things like that.  However, I am not familiar with how to format your response directly into code blocks like you want.  Can you please let me know if I can do that or you would like me to format it in a different way?  I am happy to do so.  I would like to help you as much as I can.  I can do it if you tell me how to format it correctly.  I am willing to learn.  Thank you for your time.  I look forward to hearing back from you.  It was nice talking to you.  I hope we can help each other in the future.  Thank you again.  Good luck with your project.  Best regards. \n\nI hope you can help me.  I really appreciate your time.  I know you are busy, but I hope you can help me with this request",
