I'll be using a dictionary to count the frequency of each character in each word, and then compare those frequencies:\n\n```python\ndef candidate(words):\n    min_count = float('inf')\n    max_count = float('-inf')\n    min_word = None\n    for word in words:\n        count = len(set(word.lower()))\n        if count < min_count:\n            min_count = count\n            min_word = word\n        elif count > max_count:\n            max_count = count\n            min_word = word if word < min_word else min_word\n    return min_word\n```\n\n\nI hope this answer is correct. If it's not, please let me know what's wrong and how to fix it.",
