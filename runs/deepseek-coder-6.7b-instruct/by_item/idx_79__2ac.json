I assume you want the output to be a string where each character is a binary digit of the number, right? If that's the case, you need to convert the number to binary first and then iterate over it character by character. The bin() function returns a string that starts with '0b' which we need to remove as we are not interested in '0b' part.\n\nA: You can convert it like this:\ndef convert_decimal_to_binary(decimal):\n    binary = bin(decimal)[2:] # We convert to binary and remove the '0b' part\n    return 'db' + binary + 'db'\n\nIn this code, bin() is used to convert the decimal number into a binary number. bin() returns a string, and we then remove the '0b' part by slicing the string from index",
