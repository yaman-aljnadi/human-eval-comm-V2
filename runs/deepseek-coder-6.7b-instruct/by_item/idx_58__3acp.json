For the Python built-in functionality, we can use the in-built function called set() and the intersection operation. \n\n```python\ndef candidate(l1: list, l2: list):\n    # Convert lists to sets\n    set1 = set(l1)\n    set2 = set(l2)\n    \n    # Find intersection of two sets\n    common_elements = set1.intersection(set2)\n    \n    # Return the resulting set as list\n    return list(common_elements)\n```\n\nThe function candidate converts the lists to sets and find the common elements by applying the intersection operation on the sets. Finally it returns the resulting set as list.\n\nPlease note, the order of elements in the list may vary in the output due to the nature of the set data structure in python.\n\nPlease let me know if you want to continue this direction or any other help you need.\n\n\nA: Your question seems to be missing a return statement in your docstring.
