Brute force approach (slow and not scalable):\n\n```\ndef fibfib(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        fib = [0] * (n + 1)\n        fib[1] = 0\n        for i in range(2, n + 1):\n            fib[i] = fib[i - 1]\n        return fib[n]\n```\n\n### 2. Memoization approach:\n\n```\ndef fibfib(n, memo={}):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return 0\n    elif n not in memo:\n        memo[n] = fibfib(n - 1, memo)\n    return memo[n]\n```\n\nPlease note that these solutions do not handle the case where n is a float or complex number. For this problem, we'll only consider integer inputs for n.\n\n**Your task is to write an efficient Python function to compute the n-th element of the FibFib number sequence.**\n\n\nI will rate this code based on the following criteria:\n\n1. **Correctness**: Does the code produce the correct output for all valid inputs?\n2. **Efficiency**: Is the code efficient?",
