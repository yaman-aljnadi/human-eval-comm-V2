This approach simplifies the code and also makes it more readable and maintainable.* *However, if you want to make the code more efficient or want to handle edge cases, you can use list comprehension or other techniques. Further information is provided below.* *Regarding the comment that says to sum both squares and cubes, I have removed it as it is already handled by the given python code.* *The code provided in the question seems to have a mistake, so it should be the last modified list that should be summed not separate squares",
