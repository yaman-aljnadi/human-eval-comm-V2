Can you please provide more context or an example of what is meant by \"collide\" in this context? Are we assuming that these are not physical cars but rather something related to the prime number check function being written? \n\nAdditionally, I would appreciate a better understanding of how n cars driving left to right and right to left relates to the is_prime function. How does this relate to checking whether a number is prime? Are there any specific algorithms or concepts being hinted at in this problem? \n\nPlease let me know how I can proceed and if I'm on the right track. I'm happy to continue working on this problem once I have a better understanding of what is being asked. Thank you for your feedback. \n\n#### Leave this space for your response ####\n```python\n```\n#### Clarifying Questions (if any) will be left below the markdown code block if provided. ####\n```\n```\nLet me",
