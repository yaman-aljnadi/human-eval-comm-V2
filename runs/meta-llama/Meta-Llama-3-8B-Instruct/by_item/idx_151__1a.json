I will not make any assumptions about the clarifying questions.)  ```\n\nPlease go ahead and respond. If I need to ask any clarifying questions, I will do so separately. Thank you for your help.  ```\n\n(Also, please do not assume anything about what I might or might not know. I will ask any necessary clarifying questions if I need to.)  ```\n\nPlease go",
