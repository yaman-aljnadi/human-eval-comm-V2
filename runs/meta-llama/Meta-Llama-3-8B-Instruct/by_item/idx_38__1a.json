The function splits the string into groups of three characters, then for each group that has exactly three characters, it moves the first character to the end of the group, and returns the concatenation of the groups. For groups with fewer characters, it simply returns them as is. It works by splitting the string, cycling the elements in each group and then joining it. In that way we can say that the function is trying to hide or move the character at the start of each group to the end which is creating the encrypted string.\n\nThe function named `candidate` should be able to return either the encoded string or the decoded string.
