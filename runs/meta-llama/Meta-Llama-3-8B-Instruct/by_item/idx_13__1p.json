With below information, please either generate Python3 code (Respond directly with code only with markdown), or ask clarifying questions:\n\ndef candidate(...) -> int:\n    \"\"\" Return a greatest common divisor\n    \"\"\"\n\n\nI understand, based on the description, that I should be solving the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers. \n\nHere is the Python code:\n```python\ndef candidate(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Return a greatest common divisor\n    \"\"\"\n    while b:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n```\nPlease correct me or provide the actual correct code if my understanding is wrong. Also, please note that the code will be used in a production environment. Hence, code quality and efficiency are crucial. \n\nLastly, provide a brief explanation for your code. Please ensure that it's understandable by a non-expert in programming. What does the code actually do, and how does it calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers?  How does the code ensure it is both efficient and reliable? \n\nThanks!
