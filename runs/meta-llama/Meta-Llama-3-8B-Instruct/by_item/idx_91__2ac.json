This code assumes sentences are separated by '.', '?', or '!' and words are separated by spaces. Also, the given words (W, I) should be used to filter the boredoms. It counts the number of sentences that start with given words and subtracts those from the total count of sentences, thus effectively counting the number of boredoms. ",
