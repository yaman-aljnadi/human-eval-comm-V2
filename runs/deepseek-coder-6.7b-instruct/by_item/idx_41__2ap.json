In other words, when n cars drive left and n cars drive right at the same time. \n\nSince we have 2*n cars, if any of them gets to the end of the road, they will be back on the other side, essentially making them not moving at all. This means the time taken to travel half of the road will be 0, so it's equivalent to the collision happening on the first road section.\n\nThis means the earliest moment where a collision will occur is when n cars cross the line, or on the road that's halfway marked with markdown.\n    \"\"\"\n    return n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nTest:\nprint(candidate(5)) # should return 5\n\"\"\"\n\nThe test should return 5 because there are 5 cars.
