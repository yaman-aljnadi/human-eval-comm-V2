Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Here is the Python code that satisfies your requirements:\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef rescale(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:\n    \"\"\" Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,\n    such that the one number will become 0 and another will become 1\n    \"\"\"\n\n    min_val = min(numbers)\n    max_val = max(numbers)\n    range_val = max_val - min_val\n\n    return [(x - min_val) / range_val for x in numbers]\n```\n\nIn this function, first we find the minimum and maximum values in the given list and calculate the range. Then, we perform a linear transformation on each number in the list using the formula `(x - min) / range`. This transformation scales all numbers in the list to the range [0, 1] with one value becoming 0 and another becoming 1.\nThis is done by subtracting the",
