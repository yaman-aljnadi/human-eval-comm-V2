The above code follows a recursive approach. Also, the code used 'eval' function which evaluates a string as a Python expression. This can be a potential security risk if the input strings are not validated. In a real-world scenario, you would want to ensure that the user can't manipulate the expression in a way that would allow them to execute arbitrary code.**\n\n\nYou are expected to be very familiar with Python3 code and understand well about the provided code as well as know about \"eval\"",
