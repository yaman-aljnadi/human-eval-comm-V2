The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the greatest common divisor of two numbers a and b is the same as the greatest common divisor of b and the remainder when a is divided by b.\n\nPlease provide the code for this problem. \n#python\n```\n```\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is below\n```\ndef candidate(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    while b:\n        a, b = b, a - b\n    return a\n```  #### [1]\n###[2]###[3]###[4]\n#5###[6]\n###[7]\n###[8]\n###[9]\n###[10]\n###[11]\n###[12]\n###[13]###[14]\n###[15]\n###[16]\n",
