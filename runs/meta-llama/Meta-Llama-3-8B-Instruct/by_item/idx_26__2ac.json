After re-reading the prompt, I interpret the problem as follows:\n\nGiven a list of integers, remove all elements that appear more than once in the list. Retain the order of elements in the resulting list.\n\nBelow is a Python3 code snippet that implements this functionality:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef candidate(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    counts = defaultdict(int)\n    for num in numbers:\n        counts[num] += 1\n    result = []\n    for num in numbers:\n        if counts[num] == 1:\n            result.append(num)\n    return result\n```  Thank you for considering this answer. I hope it helps! Let me know if I have misinterpreted your requirements or if this code snippet does not fulfill your needs. I will be happy to help further.",
