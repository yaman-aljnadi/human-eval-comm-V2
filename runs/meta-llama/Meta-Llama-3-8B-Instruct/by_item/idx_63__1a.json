Here is the Python3 code to efficiently compute an arbitrary element of the fibfib number sequence:\n\n```\ndef fibfib(n: int):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return 0\n    if n == 2:\n        return 1\n    a, b, c = 0, 0, 1\n    for _ in range(3, n + 1):\n        a, b, c = b, c, a + b + c\n    return c\n```\n\nThis code implements the recursive definition of the fibfib sequence. It first handles the base cases where n is 0, 1, or 2, and then uses a loop to calculate the sequence up to the nth term. The final result is stored in the variable c. This approach allows for efficient computation of large values of the fibfib sequence.",
