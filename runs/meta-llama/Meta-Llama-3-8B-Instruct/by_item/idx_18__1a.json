The function should return the number of times string `b` appears in string `a`, counting overlapping occurrences.\n\nYou can ask clarifying questions before providing a Python3 code or directly provide the code. \n\n```python\n```\n\n(Please, respond with Python code only in markdown)\n\nPlease let me know if I have misunderstood the requirement.  ```python\n```\n\n[Edit:] After getting clarification: There are two questions: \n\n1. Do you want to implement a function in Python? \n\n2. How to find all overlapping cases of substring in original string. For example, \"aaa\" in \"aaaa\" (3 times), not just non-overlapping cases (2 times).\n\n```\n```python\n```\n\nMy response was initially focused on the second point, but it seems that I misunderstood the requirement. My understanding is that we need to count overlapping cases. So, the answer is:\n```python\ndef how_many_times(a: str, b: str) -> int:\n    count = 0\n    while len(a) >= len(b):\n        pos = a.find(b)\n",
