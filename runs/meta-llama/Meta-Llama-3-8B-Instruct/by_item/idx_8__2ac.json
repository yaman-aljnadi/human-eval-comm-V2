It also checks if sum equals to 0 at any point and if so, returns a tuple with both 0's. Finally, it returns the calculated product and the remaining sum. This code handles edge cases of empty list and empty sum by returning 1 and 0 respectively. It also handles cases of sum being 0 by returning 0 for both sum and product. This code should pass all given unit tests.\n```python\n```\n\nThis code directly responds with the markdown code in Python.  Ask clarifying questions if you need further details.  Happy coding! ```python 3.0.0```\n\nPlease clarify if there are any specific",
