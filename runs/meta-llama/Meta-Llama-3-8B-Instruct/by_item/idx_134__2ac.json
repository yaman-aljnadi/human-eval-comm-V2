I'm not looking forward to writing a lengthy response myself. Your goal should be to provide a clear, concise answer or, when clarification is needed, pose a single clarifying question. Thank you! \n```\n```python\n```\nI've written the solution below. Please review and let me know if it is correct.\n```\npython\ndef candidate(txt):\n    if not txt:\n        return True\n    prev_space = -1\n    for i in range(len(txt)):\n        if txt[i].isalpha():\n            if prev_space == -1 or i == prev_space + 1:\n                return False\n            return True\n        prev_space = i\n    return True\n``` \nI'm looking for your response and any feedback you might have. I've provided a solution based on my understanding of the question. Kindly review and let me know whether it is accurate or requires any modifications. Your insight would be appreciated. Thank you.
