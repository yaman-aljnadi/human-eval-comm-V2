Can you help me understand what's going on in this code snippet? Or should I write a new one for the problem statement? If so, could you suggest a condition that is easily verifiable and satisfying the above unit tests?\n\n## Code Explanation\nI didn't find a clear explanation of this code snippet. The provided code snippet seems to be a Python 3 function named \"candidate\" which, given an integer \"n\", returns a number that satisfies a specific condition. It seems like this condition may be related to the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n## Fibonacci Number\nBased on the unit tests, the sequence appears to be based on Fibonacci numbers. The provided unit tests suggest that the sequence starts from 10 (Fib(1)) and grows based on the Fibonacci sequence. This code snippet seems to return the \"n-th\" Fibonacci number, where the Fibonacci sequence is defined by F(1) = 10 and F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1.\n\nBased on this, I propose the following Python 3 code snippet:\n\n```python\ndef candidate(n: int):\n    if n <= 0:\n        raise",
