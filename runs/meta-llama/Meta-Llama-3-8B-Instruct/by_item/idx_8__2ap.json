What do you mean by \"a certain given subset of the integers in a list\"? Is it the sum and product of all positive odd numbers in the list or is there a specific subset that I have to focus on? If there is a specific subset, how will I determine it? Please provide me with examples. \n\n2. If the input contains no odd numbers, should the function still return the sum and product",
