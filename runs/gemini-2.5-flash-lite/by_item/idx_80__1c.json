The provided examples `is_happy(a) => True` and `is_happy(aa) => True` contradict the condition \"every 3 consecutive letters are distinct\" because the strings have lengths less than 3. Does the condition \"every 3 consecutive letters are distinct\" only apply if the string's length is at least 3? Or are there separate rules for strings shorter than 3 characters?\n\n2.  The example `is_happy(aabb) => True` seems to contradict the \"every 3 consecutive letters are distinct\" rule. In `aabb`, the consecutive triplets are `aab` (not distinct) and `abb` (not distinct). Could you please clarify the intended logic for this example or provide a more precise definition of \"distinct\" in this context?\n\n3.  The example `is_happy(adb) => False` also seems to imply a rule beyond just the 3 consecutive letters being distinct. `adb` has length 3, and all characters are distinct. What makes this string \"not happy\"?\n\nAssuming the primary rule is \"length is at least 3 and every 3 consecutive letters are distinct\" and that the provided examples are meant",
