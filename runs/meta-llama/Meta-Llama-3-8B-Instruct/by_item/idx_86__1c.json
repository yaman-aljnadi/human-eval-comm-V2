I'll be happy to help.  Thanks!  Best regards,  [Your Name].  Here is my Python3 code.  I used the `sorted()` function to sort the characters in each word and then join them back together with ''.join().  Also, I split the original string into words using `s.split()` and then joined them back together with''.join().   Let me know if there is anything else I should add or if you need further clarification.  Thank you!  Best regards,  [Your Name].  [Your Email Address].  [Your Phone Number].

My goal is to write a program that, given a string as input, produces an ordered version of the string.  The ordered version of a string is",
