Are the given words (such as \"W\", \"I\") supposed to be the first word of the sentences, and should we count the number of sentences that start with these given words?\n2.  Can there be multiple given words, or is it limited to a single given word?\n\nPlease clarify these questions or provide more information to generate the correct Python3",
