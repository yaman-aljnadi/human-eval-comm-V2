However, the examples and the return values (\"YES\" or \"NO\") only seem to indicate whether the length is prime or not.\n\nHere's what I need to confirm:\n\n1.  **Prime Number Check is the *only* condition for \"YES\"?** The problem states \"determine whether the length of intersection of these two intervals is an even or odd or prime number.\" However, the examples and the prompt to return \"YES\" or \"NO\" strongly suggest that only the *prime* aspect matters for the \"YES\" condition. Should I completely disregard whether the length is even or odd if it's not prime, or is there a separate logic for those cases? Based on the examples, it seems like if the length is *not* prime (which includes even numbers that aren't 2, and odd composite numbers), the answer is \"NO\". **Please confirm if the *only* condition for returning \"YES\" is that the intersection length is a prime number.**\n\n2.  **Definition of \"prime number\" for lengths:** Standard prime numbers are positive integers",
