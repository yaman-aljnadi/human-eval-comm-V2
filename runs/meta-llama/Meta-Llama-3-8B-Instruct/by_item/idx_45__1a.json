This means the function should return the area of the triangle.\nThe side length is represented by x, and high is represented by y.\nHere is a simple triangle formula for the area: (1/2) \\* x \\* y\n\nCan you implement this in Python3? Here is the code that I have tried. Your response should be the complete code or a simple request for clarification:\n\nHere is my code: \n\n```python\ndef candidate(x, y):\n    area = (1/2) * x * y\n    return area\n```\n\nHowever, my code doesn't pass the given unit test. Specifically, it does not return 7.5 when called with (5, 3). What could be the issue with my code? How can you improve it? Here is the output of my code:\n\n```python\ncandidate(5, 3)\n```\n\n\nOutput:\n3.75\n\nSo what is missing in my code to match the expected output? Is it related to floating point precision? Or could it be a problem with my understanding of floating point arithmetic in Python",
