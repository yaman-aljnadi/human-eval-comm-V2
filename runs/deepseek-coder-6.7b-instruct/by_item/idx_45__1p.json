I need help to write that piece of code. I'm trying to accomplish this task with you.\n\nA: Here you go:\n```\nresult = 0.5 * a * h\n```\n\nJust type in a and h with your actual numbers and you get your result. Note that 'a' and 'h' are input from your users, and the calculation goes like:\n\nresult = 0.5 * a * h \n\nJust replace 'a' and 'h' with your actual values.\n\nThis should give you your answer.",
