This is because the variable N is not a string, it is a string that represents a hexadecimal number. How can I solve this?\n\nA: In your current setup N isn't iterable because it's an integer. The task is to first convert N to a string in the specific base, then iterate over its digits. We will convert the integer to a string and then use a loop to add up the digits.\n\nIf you want to stick with the original code, the below modification will allow you to calculate the sum of the digits in any base from 2 to 16:\n\n```python\ndef solve(N, base_to_convert=16):\n    return hex(sum(int(digit, base",
