I understand the basics of the FibFib sequence but I want to understand the underlying algorithm used to solve this. This would enable me to understand other similar sequence patterns as well. How would you approach such a problem? \n\nIs this a problem where dynamic programming could be applied?\n\n```python\ndef fibfib(n: int):\n    fib_seq = [0, 0, 1] + [0] * (n - 2)\n    for i in range(3, n + 1):\n        fib_seq[i] = fib_seq[i",
