What I would like to know is whether my understanding of the problem is correct. For instance, are we allowed to use built-in sorting functions? Or are we required to implement a sorting algorithm manually? Are there any specific edge cases that we should be aware of, such as what to do with an empty input list or a list containing only one element? \n\nThank you for pointing out any mistakes I might make. I'll make sure to write clean and readable code, and explain my thought process. \n\nI will be writing code in Python 3. \n\nPlease clarify the following:\n* Are we allowed to use built-in sorting functions or do we need to implement a custom sorting algorithm?\n* How do we handle ties (e.g., if two or more elements have the same sum of digits, but are in different order in the original list)?\n* Are there any specific edge cases we should be aware of, like what to do with an empty input list or a list containing only one element?\n* Are there any specific requirements for performance, like time or space complexity?\n\nOnce I have clarified my understanding, I will",
