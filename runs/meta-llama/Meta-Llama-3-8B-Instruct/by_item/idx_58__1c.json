Here are some examples of what the function should do. It's not clear to me how to handle duplicates in the common elements list, since it is not specified whether you should return duplicates in the order they appear in either list or just unique common elements in sorted order.\n\n### Code:\n\n```\npython\ndef common(l1: list, l2: list):\n    return sorted(set([i for i in l1 if i in l2]))\n```  |  |\n\n## : Construction of a list with duplicates in both lists\nThe provided function doesn't correctly handle the situation where there are duplicates in both input lists. The input function should return duplicate common elements in the order they first appeared in either list.\n\nFor instance, in the test case provided, in the input lists 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5, and 5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121, the numbers 1, 5, 5 appear more than once in both input lists.
