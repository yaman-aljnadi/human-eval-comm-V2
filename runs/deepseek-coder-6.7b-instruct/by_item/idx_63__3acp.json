The Fibonacci sequence problem was initially introduced in the \"fibfib_table\" initialization. The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recursive rule: fib(0) = 0, fib(1) = 1, and fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2). In this revised implementation, the sequence is extended by taking the sum of the last two elements of the sequence (noting that the initial sequence starts with 0",
