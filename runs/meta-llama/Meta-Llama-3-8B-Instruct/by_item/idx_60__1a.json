Best regards.\n```python\n````\n1.  candidate(n: int) -> int: This is a function that takes an integer as input and returns an integer as output.\n\nThis is the original problem description from the interviewer. \n\nBased on the provided unit tests, we can infer that the candidate function should sum up all numbers up to and including n. This could be interpreted as the sum of consecutive integers from 1 to n. \n\nTo fulfill this requirement, we can use Python's built-in range function and the sum function from the math module. The range function generates a sequence",
