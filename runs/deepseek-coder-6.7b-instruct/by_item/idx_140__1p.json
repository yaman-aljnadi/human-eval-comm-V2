Hence, no replacement is necessary.\n\nQuestion 2: What should be the code?\nHere is the corrected python code:\n\n```python\ndef fix_spaces(text):\n    return text.replace(\" \", \"_\")\n```\nIn the code, we're simply replacing all spaces in the input string text with underscores. We haven't considered the case where the string has more than 2 consecutive spaces as described in the problem statement.\n\"\"\"\n\n    return text.replace(\"   \", \"__\")\n```\n\nFor Question 3: \nIn the given string, there is not an occurrence of \"spaces of more than 2\" but the string has two spaces which should be replaced by an underscore and there is no case where there are more than 2 consecutive spaces. Hence, no replacement is necessary.\n\nQuestion 4: The code to replace the double spaces with underscores is:\n\n```python\ndef fix_spaces(text):\n    return text.replace(\"  \", \"_\")\n```\n\nIn the",
