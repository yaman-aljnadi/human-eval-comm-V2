Are spaces in the string significant? If yes, should they be kept in the resulting string? For example, \"Hello World\" should be split into \"Hello\" and \"World\"?\n2. Are there any restrictions on how the characters within a word are ordered (e.g. alphabetical, reverse alphabetical, etc.)?\n3. Are there any specific cases that should be handled (e.g. punctuation, non-ASCII characters, etc.)?```   ```\n\n0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0\n\nHere is my code with no punctuation. Let me know if you need anything else. 0x0\n```python\ndef anti_shuffle(s):\n    return ''.join(word[::-1] if word else word for word in s.split())\n```\nI would appreciate any feedback. I can explain my thought process if needed. I hope my code is correct. It works on some simple test cases.\nLet",
