If both conditions are met, we add the character to our result. The conditions ensure that only words separated by spaces are included in our output.````\n```python\ndef words_in_sentence(sentence):\n    result = \"\"\n    for i in range(len(sentence)):\n        if sentence[i].isalpha() and (i == 0 or not sentence[i-1].isalpha()):\n            if not result:\n                result += sentence[i]\n            elif sentence[i-1] == \" \":\n                result += sentence[i]\n    return result\n````\n**Explanation:**\nWe loop through the sentence characters, checking for two conditions: if a character",
