This is the way documentation works in Python. You would typically include docstrings at the top of your.py files that explain what the code does, explain what functions and classes do, and provide examples of how to use them. This way, when you open the file and look at the code, you already understand what it does. \n\nThe examples in the docstring seem to be inputs and their corresponding expected outputs for the function `correct_bracketing()`.
