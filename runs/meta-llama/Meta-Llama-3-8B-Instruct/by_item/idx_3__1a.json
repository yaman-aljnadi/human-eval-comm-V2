If yes then it would work for this test cases provided. However, if not, please ask clarifying questions before generating code. Thank you for your help.`\n```python\n```\n\nPython3 code:\n\n```python\noperations = [1, 2, 3]\nif sum(operations) < 0:\n  print('True')\nelse:\n  print('False')\n```\nPlease let me know, if it's correct or do I need to make any changes. Your comments will be valuable in this. \nIt seems like this problem needs a more precise and efficient solution, as this naive approach will result in an error if the operations exceed the maximum limit allowed by the Python's built-in `sum()` function. We need to find out a way to address this. Thank you again. \n\nHere's my take on the problem:\nIn the given scenario, the code provided earlier does not fully satisfy the conditions of the problem statement. The issue here lies in the way it handles operations",
