Also, would you mind explaining the code in a bit more detail? How does it iterate over each character in the string, and what exactly does the condition `c.isalpha()` do? \n\nLastly, would you mind elaborating on what does the expression `c.swapcase()` do? How does it convert the case of a character from lower to upper or vice versa? \n\nAlso, how does it deal with the transformation when the string contains no letters? According to the problem statement, it should return some default transformation. I did not see any condition for that case. How would I handle that in the given code? \n\nI would appreciate it if you could explain and clarify all these aspects.  Thank you.  I am just learning and I hope to understand the code better by knowing these details. \n\nPlease give a concise answer. \n\nThank you for your prompt response.  I",
