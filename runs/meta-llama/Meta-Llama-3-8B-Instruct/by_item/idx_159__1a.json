Ask clarifying questions)  1. Are there any specific rules regarding when the rabbit eats or doesn't eat the remaining carrots? For instance, does the rabbit only eat the remaining carrots if there are not enough remaining carrots to complete the day's meals? 2. If there are remaining carrots left after eating, but the rabbit still needs more, does it eat all remaining carrots or stops at the remaining number of carrots left? 3. If the rabbit needs more than the remaining number of carrots, but there are no remaining carrots left, does it eat all remaining carrots and still show the remaining number of carrots left as zero?  4. Are there any scenarios where the rabbit may still be hungry after eating all remaining carrots? If yes, what are these scenarios? 5. Are there any limitations or restrictions on the number of carrots the rabbit can eat or needs to eat, besides the given constraints of 0 <= number <= 1000, 0 <= need <= 1000, and 0 <= remaining <= 1000?  6",
