As the list is reverse sorted, after the largest number the frequency of all the rest numbers are already considered (they're going backwards).\n\nIf the frequency of a number is equal to the number itself, we return that number as our result.\n\nIf no such a number is found in the list, we return -1.\n\nNote: The assumption here is that",
