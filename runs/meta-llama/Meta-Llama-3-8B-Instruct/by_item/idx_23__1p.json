I look forward to learning from you.  Kind regards, [Name].  [Your Company].  [Your Email].  [Your Phone].  [Your LinkedIn profile].  \n---\n\nNote: \n- The code you provided seems correct.  It checks for empty string and returns its length otherwise.  So, I'm going to assume that your task is to generate this function in Python3.  \n- My apologies for not being able to provide a Python3 code earlier.  I'll make sure to double-check in the future.  \n- Your feedback is much appreciated.  Please feel free to ask questions or clarify further if needed.  \n- Thank you again for your assistance.  I'm excited to learn and grow with your help.  \n- Please let me know if you require any further assistance.  Your time",
