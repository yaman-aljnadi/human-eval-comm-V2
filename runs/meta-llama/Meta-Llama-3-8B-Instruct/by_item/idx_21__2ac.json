Are they the minimum and maximum, or something else? Would you like me to assume a default behavior based on the provided test case?\n\n```python\ndef rescale(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:\n    min_val = min(numbers)\n    max_val = max(numbers)\n    return [(x - min_val) / (max_val - min_val) for x in numbers]\n```  | **Code Response** | This code snippet assumes we want to map the minimum and maximum values to 0 and 1, respectively, and applies a linear transformation to achieve this. It finds the minimum and maximum values in the input list, and then normalizes each value to a scale from 0 to 1 by subtracting the minimum and dividing by the range. **Clarification Question**: Am I correct in assuming we want to normalize the values based on their absolute values (minimum to maximum)? Or do you have a different requirement? **Code Explanation**: The code iterates over each number in the input list, subtracts the minimum value to shift the scale, and then divides the result by the range (maximum - minimum)",
