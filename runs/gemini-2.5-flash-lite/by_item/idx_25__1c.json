  "generated_text": "I understand your request to generate Python code for the `factorize` function. However, the provided docstring examples seem to describe a different behavior than what is typically understood by \"prime factorization.\"\n\nSpecifically, the examples:\n\n*   `factorize(8) == [2, 4, 8]`\n*   `factorize(25) == [5, 25]`\n*   `factorize(70) == [2, 10, 70]`\n\nThese outputs suggest that the function should return a list of numbers that, when multiplied together, equal the input `n`. However, these are not necessarily **prime** factors, and the order doesn't strictly follow from smallest to largest in the context of prime factorization (e.g., in `[2, 4, 8]`, 4 is not prime, and `2 * 4 * 8` is not 8).\n\nIf the intention is indeed to find a list of factors (not necessarily prime) that multiply to `n`, then the examples are a bit ambiguous about the specific algorithm to choose these factors. For instance, for `n=8`, `[2, 2, 2]` is also",
