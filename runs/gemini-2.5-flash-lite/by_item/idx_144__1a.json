If just one, which one should it prioritize or check?\n*   If both multiplication and addition are to be checked, should the function return `True` if *either* operation results in a whole number, or if *both* operations result in a whole number?\n*   The examples suggest the function takes two string arguments, `a` and `b`, representing the fractions. This aligns with the function signature `def simplify(a, b):`.\n\nOnce these points are clarified, I can proceed with generating the Python 3 code.",
