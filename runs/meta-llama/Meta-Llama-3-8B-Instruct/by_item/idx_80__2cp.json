A string is considered as \"happy\" if all characters in the string are same. I used `set(s)` to create a set of unique characters from the string and compared its size with 1. If the size is 1, it means all characters in the string are same and hence the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.  It directly checks each character in the string without generating all possible subsequences. Therefore, it is much more efficient and scales well.  ```python\n```  ```\n```python\n```  ```\n```\n```\n```python  1.  `set(s)` will   have more than  1 if there are different characters in the string\n2.  `len(set(s)) == 1` check all characters in the string have to be same\nIf you want to check if there are different characters in the string,   you can check",
