The prime numbers that are \"less\" than the given input should come first, followed by the prime numbers that are \"more\" than the given input, while respecting the \"more or less than\" clause. We must also make sure that we only consider the last or first \"n\" prime numbers.\n\nHere are some crucial clarifying inquiries to address before I proceed to create the Python code:\n\n",
