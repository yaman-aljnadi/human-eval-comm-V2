My current understanding is: I need to find a solution based on set operations (complement operation? Is that a correct term?). I have tried:\n\n```\ndef unique_digits(x):\n    return sorted([i for i in x if i not in x])\n```\nThis does not work as expected.\n\nPlease provide a correct implementation for the given function in Python3. I'm grateful for any assistance.\n\n```\nHere is the corrected Python code:\n###python\ndef unique_digits(x):\n    return sorted([i for i in range(1, max(x) + 1) if i not in x])\n```  ```\n\nI hope the provided answer is what you were looking for. I understand that my understanding was incorrect. Now, I can proceed with writing the corrected Python code. Thank you for your support. If you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to ask. I am here to help.",
