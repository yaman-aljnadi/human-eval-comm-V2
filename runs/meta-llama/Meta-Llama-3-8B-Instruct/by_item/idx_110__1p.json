What are the list of elements that should be exchanged for each of these given lists? \n2. How will you implement an exchange of elements between these given lists? \n3. What should you return in the end?\n```\n```\n\n### Code Solution:\n\n```python\ndef exchange(lst1, lst2):\n    if set(lst1).symmetric_difference(set(lst2))!= set():\n        for i in set(lst1).symmetric_difference(set(lst2)):\n            lst1[lst1.index(i)], lst2[lst2.index(i)] = lst2[lst2.index(i)], lst1[lst1.index(i)]\n    return lst1, lst2\n```\n```\n\n\nThe following questions were asked to clarify this problem: \n\n1. What does the question mean by \"exchange of elements\"? This helped determine the answer in question 1. \n\n2. What data structure(s) should be used to efficiently solve this problem? Answered with \"set\" to track unique elements and then find their locations in the original lists.\n\n3. What should be returned in the end?",
