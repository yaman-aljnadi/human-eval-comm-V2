        "Inflation (economics) is a general increase in the prices of goods and services in an economy. When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; consequently, inflation reflects a reduction in the purchasing power per unit of money – a loss of real value in the medium of exchange and unit of account within an economy.",
        "The opposite of inflation is deflation, a sustained decrease in the general price level of goods and services. The common measure of inflation is the inflation rate, the annual percentage change in a general price index, usually the consumer price index, over time. As prices do not all increase at the same rate, the consumer price index (CPI) is often used for this purpose. The prices of services, for example, tend to increase faster than the prices of goods. The broader retail price index (RPI) also includes the prices of housing, such as rents and house prices, and other financial services.",
        "Economists generally believe that high rates of inflation and hyperinflation are caused by an excessive growth of the money supply. Views on the low to moderate rates of inflation are more varied. Low inflation may be attributed to fluctuations in real demand for goods and services, or to changes in available supplies such as during scarcities. However, the consensus view is that a long sustained period of inflation is caused by money supply growing faster than the rate of economic growth. This is because the velocity of money is relatively stable, so the rate of inflation is approximately the rate of money growth minus the rate of real output growth.",
        "Inflation affects economies in various positive and negative ways. The negative effects of inflation include an increase in the opportunity cost of holding money, uncertainty over future inflation which may discourage investment and savings, and if inflation is rapid enough, shortages of goods if consumers begin hoarding out of concern that prices will increase in the future. Positive effects include reducing the real burden of debt, and also reducing unemployment to some extent due to nominal wage rigidity.",
        "Some economists consider a moderate amount of inflation to be necessary for economic growth, as it reduces the severity of economic recessions by enabling the labor market to adjust more quickly in a downturn, and reduces the risk that a liquidity trap prevents monetary policy from stimulating the economy. However, the task of keeping inflation at a low, stable, and predictable rate is entrusted to monetary authorities. These authorities generally are the central banks that control monetary policy through the setting of interest rates, by carrying out open market operations, and by reserve requirements."

        "Early history: The earliest large-scale inflation occurred after the discovery of the New World when silver and gold flowed from the Americas to Europe. From the mid-16th century to mid-17th century, prices in Europe rose gradually at a rate of 1-1.5% per year, in what has been called the 'price revolution'. The price revolution was caused by the large influx of American silver and gold, and population growth. The silver and gold were used for coinage, and the quantity of money in circulation increased.",
        "20th century: The 20th century saw many periods of inflation, especially during wartime. The US experienced large inflations during World War I and World War II. The value of the British pound fell by 99% due to inflation between 1914 and 1992. Many other countries have experienced similar or worse inflation. The German hyperinflation of the 1920s and the Zimbabwean hyperinflation of the 2000s are notable examples. After World War II, many countries adopted the Bretton Woods system, which pegged their currencies to the US dollar. This system broke down in the early 1970s, and many countries experienced high inflation during the 1970s and early 1980s. This period is often called the 'Great Inflation'.",
        "The Great Inflation: The Great Inflation was a period of high inflation that affected many countries during the 1970s and early 1980s. It was caused by a combination of factors, including the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, the oil price shocks of 1973 and 1979, and expansionary monetary and fiscal policies. The Great Inflation led to a significant increase in unemployment and a decrease in economic growth. Many central banks adopted inflation targeting policies in the 1990s to combat inflation.",
        "21st century: The early 21st century saw a period of relatively low inflation in many developed countries, sometimes referred to as 'The Great Moderation'. However, the 2007–2008 financial crisis and the subsequent Great Recession led to concerns about deflation. More recently, the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine have led to a surge in inflation in many parts of the world, driven by supply chain disruptions, increased demand, and energy price increases."

        "Deflation: Deflation is a decrease in the general price level of goods and services. Deflation occurs when the inflation rate falls below 0% (a negative inflation rate). Inflation reduces the real value of money over time; conversely, deflation increases the real value of money – the currency unit buys more goods and services than before. Deflation is distinct from disinflation, which is a slowing in the rate of inflation (i.e., when inflation declines but remains positive).",
        "Disinflation: Disinflation is a decrease in the rate of inflation. For example, if the annual inflation rate falls from 5% to 2%, this is disinflation. Prices are still rising, but at a slower pace.",
        "Hyperinflation: Hyperinflation is a very rapid, uncontrolled, and accelerating increase in the general price level. It is typically defined as an inflation rate exceeding 50% per month. Hyperinflation is often caused by an excessive growth of the money supply, usually due to governments printing money to finance their spending. Hyperinflation can lead to severe economic instability, as people lose faith in the currency and resort to bartering or using foreign currencies.",
        "Stagflation: Stagflation is a condition of slow economic growth and relatively high unemployment (economic stagnation) accompanied by rising prices (inflation). It is a combination of inflation and stagnation. Stagflation is a particularly difficult economic problem to address, as policies designed to combat inflation (e.g., higher interest rates) can worsen stagnation, while policies designed to combat stagnation (e.g., fiscal stimulus) can worsen inflation. It was famously observed in the 1970s.",
        "Reflation: Reflation is the act of stimulating the economy by increasing the money supply or by reducing taxes, seeking to bring the economy back to its long-term trend after a period of contraction. It is the opposite of disinflation, and is used to describe a policy that aims to raise the general price level to counter deflationary pressures.",
        "Asset price inflation: Asset price inflation is an increase in the prices of assets such as stocks, real estate, and other financial instruments, without a corresponding increase in the prices of goods and services. This can lead to bubbles in asset markets, which can burst and cause financial crises.",
        "Wage inflation: Wage inflation refers to the rate at which wages increase over time. It is a key component of overall inflation, as labor costs are a significant factor in the production of goods and services. Rapid wage inflation can contribute to a wage-price spiral, where rising wages lead to higher prices, which in turn lead to demands for higher wages.",
        "Core inflation: Core inflation is a measure of inflation that excludes volatile items such as food and energy prices. It is often used by central banks to get a clearer picture of underlying inflation trends, as food and energy prices can be subject to temporary fluctuations that do not reflect broader economic conditions."

        "Demand-pull inflation: Demand-pull inflation occurs when aggregate demand in an economy outweighs aggregate supply. This means that there is more money chasing fewer goods, leading to an increase in prices. It is often associated with a strong economy, low unemployment, and expansionary monetary or fiscal policies. For example, if consumers have more disposable income and want to buy more goods and services than the economy can produce, prices will rise.",
        "Cost-push inflation: Cost-push inflation occurs when the cost of producing goods and services increases, leading businesses to raise their prices to maintain profit margins. This can be caused by various factors, such as rising wages, higher raw material costs (e.g., oil prices), or increased taxes. For example, if the price of oil increases, transportation costs for businesses will rise, leading to higher prices for goods that need to be transported.",
        "Built-in inflation: Built-in inflation is a type of inflation that results from past inflation and expectations of future inflation. It is often associated with a wage-price spiral, where workers demand higher wages to compensate for rising prices, and businesses raise prices to cover higher labor costs. This creates a self-perpetuating cycle of inflation. Built-in inflation is a key factor in persistent inflation and can be difficult to break once it becomes entrenched in the economy."

        "Historically, a great deal of economic literature was devoted to the question of what causes inflation and what effect it has. There are different schools of thought on the causes of inflation:",
        "Monetarist view: The monetarist view, championed by Milton Friedman, states that \"inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.\" According to this view, inflation is primarily caused by an excessive growth of the money supply relative to the growth of real output. When the money supply increases faster than the availability of goods and services, the value of each unit of currency decreases, leading to higher prices. Monetarists advocate for central banks to control the money supply to maintain price stability.",
        "Keynesian view: The Keynesian view emphasizes the role of aggregate demand in causing inflation. According to Keynesian economics, inflation can be caused by demand-pull factors, where an increase in aggregate demand (due to government spending, consumer spending, or investment) exceeds the economy's ability to produce goods and services. This leads to upward pressure on prices. Keynesians also acknowledge the role of cost-push factors, such as rising wages or raw material costs, in causing inflation. They often suggest fiscal and monetary policies to manage aggregate demand.",
        "Supply-side view: The supply-side view focuses on factors that affect the supply of goods and services. According to this view, inflation can be caused by reductions in aggregate supply, such as supply chain disruptions, natural disasters, or government regulations that restrict production. When the supply of goods and services decreases while demand remains constant, prices tend to rise. Supply-side economists often advocate for policies that promote production and reduce the cost of doing business.",
        "Rational expectations theory: Rational expectations theory suggests that people's expectations about future inflation play a significant role in determining current inflation. If people expect prices to rise in the future, they will demand higher wages and businesses will raise prices, leading to a self-fulfilling prophecy. This theory implies that credible monetary policy is crucial for managing inflation, as it can influence people's expectations.",
        "The quantity theory of money states that the general price level of goods and services is directly proportional to the amount of money in circulation, or money supply. The equation of exchange, M V = P T, where M is the money supply, V is the velocity of money (the average number of times a unit of money is spent in a given period), P is the price level, and T is the volume of transactions. If V and T are relatively stable, then an increase in M will lead to an increase in P. This theory is a cornerstone of the monetarist view of inflation.",
        "Money supply: The money supply is the total amount of currency in circulation and demand deposits in an economy. An excessive increase in the money supply, not matched by an increase in real output, is widely considered a primary cause of sustained inflation. Central banks manage the money supply through various tools, such as interest rates, open market operations, and reserve requirements.",
        "Government spending and fiscal policy: Government spending can contribute to inflation if it leads to an increase in aggregate demand that exceeds the economy's productive capacity. Fiscal policies, such as tax cuts or increased government spending, can stimulate demand and potentially lead to inflation if not managed carefully. When governments finance their spending by printing money (monetizing the debt), it directly increases the money supply and can lead to hyperinflation.",
        "Exchange rates: Fluctuations in exchange rates can also affect inflation. A depreciation of a country's currency makes imports more expensive and exports cheaper. The increased cost of imports can contribute to inflation, as businesses pay more for imported goods and raw materials. This is known as imported inflation.",
        "Expectations: Inflationary expectations play a critical role in the inflation process. If consumers and businesses expect prices to rise, they may demand higher wages and set higher prices, creating a self-reinforcing cycle. Central banks often try to anchor inflation expectations to keep inflation stable."

        "Negative effects: Inflation can have several negative effects on an economy. It erodes the purchasing power of money, making savings less valuable over time. It can create uncertainty, discouraging investment and economic growth. High inflation can also lead to a redistribution of wealth, as debtors benefit from repaying loans with money that is worth less than when they borrowed it, while creditors lose. It can also lead to 'menu costs' (the cost of businesses having to change prices) and 'shoe-leather costs' (the cost of people having to make more trips to the bank to manage their money). If inflation is volatile, it can make economic planning difficult.",
        "Positive effects: Inflation can also have some positive effects. A moderate amount of inflation can help to lubricate the labor market, as it allows real wages to fall without nominal wages being cut, which can be difficult for workers to accept. This can help to reduce unemployment during recessions. Inflation can also reduce the real burden of debt, making it easier for governments and individuals to repay their debts. It can also prevent deflation, which can be more damaging to an economy than moderate inflation.",
        "Redistribution of income and wealth: Inflation can redistribute income and wealth. For instance, if prices rise faster than wages, workers' real income declines. Debtors benefit from inflation as the real value of their debt decreases, while creditors lose. This can lead to social tensions and inequality.",
        "Uncertainty: High or volatile inflation creates uncertainty about future prices and the value of money. This uncertainty can discourage investment and long-term planning by businesses and individuals, hindering economic growth.",
        "Shoe-leather costs: The term 'shoe-leather costs' refers to the costs of inflation that arise from people trying to reduce their holdings of cash. When inflation is high, money loses its value quickly, so people try to keep less cash on hand and make more frequent trips to the bank. This incurs time and effort costs.",
        "Menu costs: 'Menu costs' are the costs associated with changing prices. Businesses incur costs when they have to update their price lists, menus, and catalogs due to inflation. These costs can be significant, especially for businesses with many products or frequent price changes.",
        "Impact on savings and investment: Inflation erodes the real value of savings, discouraging people from saving. It can also distort investment decisions, as people may invest in assets that are perceived to be inflation-proof (e.g., real estate, gold) rather than in productive assets. This can lead to misallocation of resources.",
        "Impact on international trade: High inflation can make a country's exports more expensive and imports cheaper, leading to a decline in net exports and a trade deficit. This can weaken the country's currency and further exacerbate inflation.",
        "Impact on economic growth: While moderate inflation can sometimes stimulate economic growth by reducing the real burden of debt and facilitating labor market adjustments, high and unpredictable inflation is generally detrimental to economic growth. It creates uncertainty, distorts price signals, and can lead to inefficient resource allocation."

      "content": [
        "Inflation is typically measured by calculating the percentage change in a price index over time. The most commonly used price indexes include:",
        "Consumer Price Index (CPI): The CPI measures the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. It is a widely used measure of inflation and is often used to adjust wages, pensions, and other payments for inflation. Different countries use slightly different methodologies for calculating their CPI.",
        "Producer Price Index (PPI): The PPI measures the average change over time in the selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. It is an indicator of inflationary pressures at the wholesale or producer level and can often foreshadow changes in the CPI.",
        "Wholesale Price Index (WPI): The WPI measures the average change in the prices of goods at the wholesale level. It is similar to the PPI and is used in some countries as a key measure of inflation.",
        "Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index: The PCE price index measures the average change over time in the prices of goods and services purchased by consumers in the United States. It is preferred by the Federal Reserve as a measure of inflation because it accounts for changes in consumer behavior and substitution effects. The core PCE index excludes volatile food and energy prices.",
        "GDP deflator: The GDP deflator measures the average level of prices of all new, domestically produced, final goods and services in an economy. It is a broader measure of inflation than the CPI or PPI, as it includes investment goods and government purchases, not just consumer goods. It is calculated by dividing nominal GDP by real GDP and multiplying by 100.",
        "Headline inflation vs. core inflation: Headline inflation refers to the raw inflation figure reported through the CPI, PPI, or WPI. Core inflation excludes the prices of volatile items like food and energy from the overall inflation measure. Central banks often focus on core inflation to get a better sense of underlying inflationary trends, as food and energy prices can fluctuate significantly due to temporary supply shocks.",
        "Hedonic adjustments: Hedonic adjustments are used in price indexes to account for changes in the quality of goods and services over time. For example, if a new computer is more powerful than an older model but costs the same, a hedonic adjustment would treat this as a price decrease, reflecting the increased value for money. This helps to prevent price indexes from overstating inflation by not accounting for quality improvements.",
        "Median CPI and Trimmed-mean CPI: These are alternative measures of core inflation that aim to reduce the impact of extreme price changes in specific categories. The median CPI measures the inflation rate of the component whose price change is in the middle of the distribution of all price changes. The trimmed-mean CPI excludes a certain percentage of the highest and lowest price changes from the calculation, providing a more stable measure of underlying inflation."

        "Monetary policy: Monetary policy is the primary tool used by central banks to control inflation. Central banks can influence the money supply and interest rates to manage aggregate demand in the economy. The main tools of monetary policy include:",
        "- Interest rates: Central banks can raise or lower policy interest rates (e.g., the federal funds rate in the US, the repo rate in the UK). Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, which discourages spending and investment, thereby reducing aggregate demand and inflationary pressures. Lower interest rates have the opposite effect.",
        "- Open market operations: Central banks can buy or sell government securities in the open market. Selling securities reduces the money supply, while buying securities increases it. This directly affects the amount of money in circulation.",
        "- Reserve requirements: Central banks can set the minimum reserves that banks must hold. Increasing reserve requirements reduces the amount of money banks have available to lend, thereby contracting the money supply. This tool is used less frequently.",
        "Inflation targeting: Many central banks, including the European Central Bank, the Bank of England, and the Reserve Bank of Australia, have adopted inflation targeting as their monetary policy framework. Under this framework, the central bank publicly announces a target inflation rate (e.g., 2% per year) and then uses its policy tools to steer inflation towards that target. This approach aims to anchor inflation expectations and provide transparency.",
        "Exchange rate policy: In some countries, particularly those with fixed exchange rates, exchange rate policy can be used to control inflation. By pegging its currency to a stable foreign currency, a country can import the monetary discipline of the anchor country, thus helping to keep domestic inflation in check. However, this limits the central bank's ability to conduct independent monetary policy.",
        "Wage and price controls: Wage and price controls are government interventions that directly limit how much wages and prices can increase. These controls have been used in various countries, particularly during wartime or periods of high inflation. However, they are generally considered to be ineffective in the long run and can lead to shortages, black markets, and distortions in the economy. Economists generally prefer market-based solutions.",
        "Fiscal policy: Fiscal policy involves government spending and taxation. While monetary policy is the primary tool for inflation control, fiscal policy can also play a role. Reducing government spending or increasing taxes can decrease aggregate demand, thereby reducing inflationary pressures. However, fiscal policy is often influenced by political considerations and can be less flexible than monetary policy."
