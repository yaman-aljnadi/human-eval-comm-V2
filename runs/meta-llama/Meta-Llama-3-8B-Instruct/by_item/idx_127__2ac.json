If the intersection is empty, the code directly returns \"NO\". If the intersection is a single point, it is considered as \"YES\". The code then checks if the length of the intersection is a prime number by checking whether it can be divided by any number between 2 and its square root. If it is divisible, then the intersection is not a prime number, and the code returns \"NO\". If it is not divisible by any number in this range, then the intersection is a prime number, and the code returns \"YES\".  This code ensures to correctly determine whether the length of intersection",
