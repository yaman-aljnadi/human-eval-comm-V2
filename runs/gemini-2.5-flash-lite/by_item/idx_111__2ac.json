It says \"least *or* most repetition.\" Do you want to return the letter(s) with the *absolute minimum* count, the letter(s) with the *absolute maximum* count, or does it depend on some other factor? The examples provided consistently show the *most frequent* letter(s). Please confirm if the goal is always to find the letter(s) with the *highest* frequency.\n\n2.  **\"return all of them\"**: When multiple letters share the same *highest* frequency (if that's the confirmed goal), should the dictionary contain all of them? The examples `histogram('a b b a') == {'a': 2}` and `histogram('a b c a b') == {'a': 2}` suggest only one is returned, even if 'b' also has a count of 2. Please clarify if the intention is to return *only one* of the most frequent (perhaps the first encountered alphabetically, or the first encountered in the string), or *all* letters that tie for the highest frequency.\n\nOnce these points are clarified, I can provide precise",
