Kind regards! \n``` bash\n```\nFinal Answer: The final answer is a Python program that detects if at any point the balance of a bank account falls below zero. The code is given below:\n\n```\ndef below_zero(operations: List[int]):\n    balance = 0\n    for operation in operations:\n        balance += operation\n        if balance < 0:\n            return True\n    return False\n```\n\n\n\nExplanation: The provided code defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers representing bank account operations (deposits and withdrawals) as an argument. It initializes a balance to zero and iterates through each operation in the list, adding each operation to the balance. If the balance ever falls below zero (i.e., if an operation is a withdrawal greater than the current balance), the function immediately returns `True`. If the balance remains non-negative or zero throughout the operations, the function returns `False`. The program assumes that",
