This is based on the assumption that the fractions given are valid and simplified. I first separate the fractions into their components, then I simplify the fractions by finding the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator. Then I simplify the fractions again to get the final simplified forms.\n\n```python\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    while b:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\ndef simplify(a, b):\n    ai, aj = map(int, a.split('/'))\n    bi, bj = map(int, b.split('/'))\n    ai, bj = ai * bj, bi * aj  # equivalent fractions\n    gcd_value = gcd(ai, bj)\n    return gcd_value == 1\n\n```\n\nLet me know if there's anything else you'd like me to clarify. And if you're ready to give me feedback on my code.  Would I be able to create a loop that would simplify these fractions indefinitely?\n\nPlease review my code. Let me provide you with some clarifications on my code and ask your feedback and if there's anything you'd like me to improve. \n\nThank you for your time. I hope to hear back from you soon.
