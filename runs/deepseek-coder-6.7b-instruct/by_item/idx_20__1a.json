The smallest value in the list that is not at the end, and the greatest value in the list that is not at the start. Because it's stated that list length is more than 2, the list is at least 3, so that condition is satisfied.\n\nHere's your code with this requirement included:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\ndef candidate(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float",
