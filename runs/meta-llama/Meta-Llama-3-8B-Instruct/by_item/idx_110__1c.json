If there is no such condition mentioned, I will proceed with writing code based on existing assumptions. \nIf you are happy with my understanding of the problem, then here is the code snippet:\n\n```\ndef exchange(lst1, lst2):\n    while True:\n        for i in range(len(lst1)):\n            if lst1[i] % 2!= 0:\n                for j in range(len(lst2)):\n                    if lst2[j] % 2!= 0:\n                        lst1[i], lst2[j] = lst2[j], lst1[i]\n        if all(i % 2 == 0 for i in lst1):\n            return \"YES\"\n        if any(i % 2!= 0 for i in lst2):\n            return \"NO\"\n```\n\nPlease provide any feedback or further clarification required.  \"\"\"\n\n---\n\nI am waiting for your response.  \"\"\"\n\n---\n\nPlease let me know if my solution meets your requirements.  \"\"\"\n\n---\n\nIf you are satisfied with my answer, kindly mark this question as \"Answered",
