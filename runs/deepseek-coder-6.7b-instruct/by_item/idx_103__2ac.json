But before doing so, it should ensure that the first number is not greater than the second. If the first number is greater than the second number, the function should return -1.\n\nHere's the code I've written based on your instructions:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef rounded_avg(n, m):\n    if n > m:\n        return -1\n    avg = math.ceil((n + m) / 2)\n    return bin(avg)\n```\n\nHere's an example of the function in action:\n\n```python\nprint(rounded_avg(1, 5))  # Output: '0b11'\nprint(rounded_avg(7, 5))  # Output:",
