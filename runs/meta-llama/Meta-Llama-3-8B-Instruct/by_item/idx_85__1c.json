It means that for each odd index in the given list, we need to add the corresponding even element. \n\nFor instance, in the given example, the given list is [4,2,6,7]. \n\nIn this case, the elements at odd indices are 4 and 6. \n\nAnd we need to add these two elements to get the output as 10 (i.e., 4+6 = 10). \n\nHere is the python3 code for the given problem:\n\n```\ndef add(lst):\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):\n        total += lst[i]\n    return total\n```\n\nThis code uses a for loop to iterate over the given list starting from the first odd index (1) to the end of the list, with a step of 2 to ensure only the even elements at odd indices are considered. The total is updated in each iteration and finally returned as the output. \n\nLet me know if you need further clarification or any",
