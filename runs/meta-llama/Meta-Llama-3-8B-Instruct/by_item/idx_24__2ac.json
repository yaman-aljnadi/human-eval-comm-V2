The function should return the smallest or largest number that divides `n` evenly, and is smaller than `n`.\n\nIn other words, the function needs to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `n` with itself. The GCD of a number with itself is simply the number itself, since it divides evenly with no remainder.\n\nThis is a classic problem and you are familiar with it. Provide the Python3 code to solve this task.  | code | ```\ndef candidate(n: int) -> int:\n    return n\n``` |  |\n\nPlease let me know if I'm missing something or need to make any changes. Thank you! | markdown\n```\ndef candidate(n: int) -> int:\n    return n\n```\nIt would be better to add comments to explain what the function is doing. Adding comments can make the code more understandable and can also act as documentation.\n```\ndef candidate(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"This function finds the smallest or largest number that divides n evenly, \n    smaller than n.
