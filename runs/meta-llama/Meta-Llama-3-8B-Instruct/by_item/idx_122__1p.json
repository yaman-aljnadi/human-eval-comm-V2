No assumptions should be made about them beyond their types.\n* If you are unsure how to proceed with this question, see this example:\n    ```\n    >>> add_elements([1, 12, 12345], 2)\n    1 + 12 = 13, so 13\n    ```\n    In other words, the elements with at most two digits are 1 and 12. The sum of 1 and 12 is 13.\n    ```\n    \n    # Solution Code Here\n```\n\nPlease ensure that the solution code is functionally equivalent to the mathematical operations. Be mindful of corner cases like: What if there are no elements with at most two digits? What if there are multiple elements with at most two digits? What if one or both of them have no more than two digits? Answer with Python3 code only. ",
