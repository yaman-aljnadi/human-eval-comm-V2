What should each string in the list represent?\n    *   Should each string be a complete, top-level parenthesized group (e.g., `\"(a(b))\"` and `\"(c)\"` from `\"((a(b)))(c)\"`)?\n    *   Should it be something else?\n\n2.  **What defines a \"group\"?** Are we looking for top-level, independent parenthesized expressions, or are there other criteria?\n\nOnce I have this clarification, I can provide you with the high-quality Python code.",
