You should directly provide code in response.**\n\n\n\nHere is a simple Python code to solve the problem. This code defines a function called solution that iterates over the given list. If the position of an element is even, and the element itself is even, it adds it to the total. If the position of an element is odd, and the element itself is odd, it also adds it to the total.\n\n```\ndef solution(lst):\n    total = 0\n    for i, num in enumerate(lst):\n        if (i % 2 == 0 and num % 2 == 0) or (i % 2!= 0 and num % 2!= 0):\n            total += num\n    return total\n```\n\n\n\nPlease note that position of an element is considered 0-based index. For instance, the first element in the list has an index of 0, not 1. It is considered \"even\" if its index is divisible by 2. In a similar manner, if an index is not divisible by 2, it is considered \"odd.\" Similarly, an element",
