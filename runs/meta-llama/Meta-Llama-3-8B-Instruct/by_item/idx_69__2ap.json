Do you want to find both the smallest and largest integer with frequency, or just one of them? \n2. Are there any duplicate integers in the list, or can we assume that there are no duplicates? \n3. What if there are no integers in the list with frequency greater than zero? Can we return an error, or is there a default value we should return?\n\nPlease clarify your question, and I will generate the Python3 code accordingly. \n\n---\n\nI'm waiting for your response.
