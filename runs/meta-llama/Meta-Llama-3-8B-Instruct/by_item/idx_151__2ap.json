Here is the solution to the problem:\n```\ndef double_the_difference(lst):\n    return sum([i ** 2 for i in lst if i % 2 == 0])\n``` 1\nThis code is designed to find the sum of squares of all the even numbers in a given list. 1  | 1  ** The function named `double_the_difference` accepts a list of numbers as an argument. ** The expression inside the `if` condition checks if a given number is even by dividing it by 2 and checking if it is equal to 0 (i.e., the remainder is 0).  If 1  ** 2  ** The number is even, it gets squared and then summed up with all other even numbers' squares. ** 0  ** 0  ** 1 0  | 0 1  ** If the list is empty, the function returns 0 as expected",
