The function checks each corresponding character in the inputs `a` and `b`, if they are equal append '0' to `result`, else append '1'. So, the output is a binary string that represents the bitwise operation.\n\nNow, for your requirement: Given are two binary strings `a` and `b` of the same length, you need to write a function `bit_different(a: str, b: str)` that returns the number of different bits between these two binary strings.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef bit_different(a",
