Is there anything else you need?\n\nA: If you are asking for a Python3 code to check if balance ever drops below zero, you can utilize the following Python code:\n```Python3\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef check_negative_balance(operations: List[int]) -> bool:\n    balance = 0\n    for operation in operations:\n        balance += operation\n        if balance < 0:\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    ops = [10, -5, -15, 20, 5]\n    print(check_negative_balance(ops))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n",
