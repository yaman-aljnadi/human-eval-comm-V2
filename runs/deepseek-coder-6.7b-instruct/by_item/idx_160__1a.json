Here's how:\n\n```python\ndef do_algebra(operator, array):\n    # convert the arrays to string\n    str_op = ''.join(map(str, operator))\n    str_array = ''.join(map(str, array))\n    \n    # join the string together\n    result = str_array + str_op\n    \n    # use eval to calculate the result\n    return eval(result)\n```\n\nIn this code, `operator` and `array` are lists that you pass to the function. `str_op` and `str_array` are the strings version of these lists. They are joined together to form an algebraic expression. The `eval()` function evaluates the expression and returns the result.\n\nHere's an example of how to use this function:\n\n```python\noperator = ['+', '*', '-']\narray = [2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(do_algebra(operator, array))  # prints 9\n```\n\nThis will evaluate the expression `",
