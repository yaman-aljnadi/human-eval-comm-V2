This result is then combined with the index of the number in the original list to determine the sort order. The built-in `sort()` method is used to perform the sorting operation in-place.\n\n**Test cases** (Respond directly with code only with markdown)\n\n```python\nprint(candidate([1, 11, -1, -11, -12]) == [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11])\nprint(candidate([]) == [])\n```\n**Output**\n\n```\nTrue\nTrue\n```  | Read more\n28Â years ago\n## Comment\n\nHello, I am an expert software developer and I'll be happy to help you with your Python code.
