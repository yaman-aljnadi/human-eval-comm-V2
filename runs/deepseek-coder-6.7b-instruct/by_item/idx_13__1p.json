If it is, it returns n. If it is not, it subtracts the smaller number from the larger one, and then recurses with the new n and m values. The base case is when n equals m, in which case it returns n.\n\nPlease note, there are more efficient algorithms to find the greatest common divisor. This function is a simple and easy-to-understand one. But if you are dealing with large numbers, the time complexity will be high for this function. In such case, you might want to use the Euclid's algorithm or other optimized algorithm to find the GCD.\n",
