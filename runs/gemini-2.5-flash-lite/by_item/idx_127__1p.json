To generate useful Python code, I need to know what the `intersection` function is supposed to *do* after determining something about the intervals.\n\nHere are a few possibilities for what the function might be intended to do, and I'll ask clarifying questions for each:\n\n**Possibility 1: Check if there is an intersection.**\n\n*   **Question:** Does the function need to return `True` if the intervals intersect and `False` otherwise?\n\n**Possibility 2: Return the intersecting interval.**\n\n*   **Question:** If the intervals intersect, should the function return the *interval* representing their intersection (e.g., `(start, end)`)? What should it return if they do *not* intersect? (e.g., `None`, an empty tuple, or a special value?)\n\n**Possibility 3: Calculate the length of the intersection.**\n\n*   **Question:** Should the function calculate and return the *length* of the overlapping portion of the two intervals? What should it return if there's no intersection?\n\n**Possibility 4: A more complex calculation or property.**\n\n*   **Question:** Is there a more complex property or calculation involving",
