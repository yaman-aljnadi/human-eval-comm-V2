Are both input lists sorted in any particular way (e.g., ascending or descending)?\n2. Are there any constraints on the types of elements in the input lists? For example, are they limited to integers or can they be any hashable type (e.g., strings, tuples, etc.)?\n3. What is the desired behavior if there are duplicate elements in the input lists? For example, if both lists contain the element `1`, should it be included in the output once or multiple times?\n\nPlease clarify these points and I'll be happy to provide a more informed response. | Read more | Read less\n0 answers | 0 votes\nedited 4 hours",
